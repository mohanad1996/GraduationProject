-0iLH7iQNYtoURciDpJf6w,7dwh3pL2tbSeSvL0qLzUrw,I forgot when Cheesefake factory turned from a family style restaurant into a snooty upscale" italian style restaurant. Whenever it was it was a day that will forever be labeled as a catastrophic error in strategy. Your business model is not impressive. You way overcharge for food thats quality is essentially macorni grill and you are the baker's square of cheesecake. That means you should be somewhere in those caliber of dining establishments. Prices and light fixtures are unable to convince me otherwise.",3,0,8/18/2011,7dwh3pL2tbSeSvL0qLzUrw,24,461,0
-0jddDDkxvL8ugI3UCkeOA,G7tZEGH2UeYasoFjKXqJcQ,Boasts international flavors.  Started with the cheese ans sausage soup topped with a few kernels of popcorn.  Interesting touch and complimentry flavors.  Light soup not heavy cheesy.  Also ordered the falafels which came atop salad with a light tangy yogurt dressing.  The spices in the dense falafels were superb.  I like my falafels more dense and meat-like and this was right on.  Didn't taste too fried or cornmealy. The tab came with a dark chocolate truffle bite.  Mmmmm.  Before I give more than 3 stars i'd need to try dinner.,3,0,7/20/2011,G7tZEGH2UeYasoFjKXqJcQ,13,103,0

-1kmwGmFi1rQXvFarNWIQw,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,Would have been 4 stars but the parking at this location is tiny. Three stalls and one handicapped one. This is a pull out along Sorrento Valley Blvd. where you can park and eat lunch or take a short hike up the hill and get a great view of the Los Penasquitos Valley below. No official access to the Los Penasquitos Preserve from this location but plenty of well-worn ruts down into the valley.

-3MbihhYbkYw0ZQXk1sNaQ,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,We discovered this place by sheer accident. We caught a movie at the Logan and began walking home and caught this place out of the corner of our eye. I am glad we did as it is only five blocks from home and whenever a quick ice cream/gelato fix is needed we know it is a short walk away. We took some time looking at their selection and we had a difficult time trying to figure out what we wanted. The girl behind the counter were very friendly and helpful and gave us suggestions and let us try a spoonful of anything that we wanted to sample.

I recommend getting the Blue Goose Quesadillas because its the best one in their menu in my opinion. Happy Hour is great too but I just keep on forgetting how they have great specials for Happy Hour.

-6W6knjxDJ0VT9dssbXkFA,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,Sadly this is about as good as it gets for an electronic store in Denver. Would Fry's please open here soon because this store sure needs the competition. Higher prices because they know they have you by the balls - where else are you going to go? Always long lines and abysmal parking here. I think I would rather order online than deal with the parking and staff.

-7nQboqJzTt-iCBHhaltfA,DAeC-Y66n-jNMJJw4oAfNQ,Drive past it. This place should be out of business but has been here for almost three years now. This place is rarely ever busy. Not sure how they have stayed around for a few years now. The food is so disappointing. I came in here to try their white beans and rice and left totally disappointed. The beans had no flavor. The rice was hard. I can attest that the smell in here is quite bad like Elizabeth pointed out.,1,5,1/23/2012,DAeC-Y66n-jNMJJw4oAfNQ,103,294,0

-8st5c8xnGRUOxOPGegx2A,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,I absolutely love this place! It can get pricey but the food and service rocks! Their sangria probably beats out Iberia's plus they give you so much more and not too much ice! The meats are fresh and cooked to perfection. The salad bar is small but good choices.

-9JF1m4TE8wV8QoIYUTPWQ,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I'm a little confused by Belk. I'm from the Northwest and have never heard of this chain before. I walked through with my husband and it seems to be a lower-end Macy's. It has the standard 'bedding' department and the 'clothing' department. I didn't really shop through as it wasn't my 'style' but I can see where it would fill in for Macy*s (which is not at this mall),3,0,9/6/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

-9UpJlH7f9a0xUj8Plot6A,WZq0FC-0HS6_R4pKUy_3Ig,I've been to several of the Brazilian steakhouse concepts and enjoy them all.  I really do hope 3rd time's a charm for this location though since we've had Sal y Carvao and Zed451 already. They have changed a bit of the decor inside from the previous owner (same one for both names) and the waiter's attentiveness was second to none. We went early on a Saturday as we have a 2 year old and it seems that there were plenty others there who had the same idea.  This isn't really the most kid-friendly place to bring a child but what I loved was that we weren't charged for our little guy.  I'm not sure if that's the norm or at what age that kicks in but since he had some of the salad bar items and only a little bit of the bacon-wrapped chicken he was still satisfied and full and we didn't have to g,4,1,4/20/2010,WZq0FC-0HS6_R4pKUy_3Ig,58,225,1

I'd say Blush is an awesome place to start or finish your night but if you're looking for a more LEGEN wait for it...DARY night I'd recommend picking your butt up from the really comfortable chair and walking down to Tryst or XS!

Walking in i wasn't sure if we just sat down or ordered or what then a very nice guy popped his head out and told us we order with him and he will  bring it to us easy enough. We had a pulled beef burrito platter and a chicken burrito platter both were AWESOME! A little messy but soooo good. They were quite large so we really could of probably split it for lunch. They also gave us a chips and we had tasted all the salsa's from the help yourself salsa bar they were all very fresh and very good.

It's a nice hotel don't get me wrong it's kind of not my style if I wanted to stay there I've stayed in better hotels than this one. It looks too boughie for me and it seems like it has nothing on hotels like the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton where world class service is part of the hotel's mantra. This place just looked like you come in for an after work drink and then go home.

My only issue was the style of clothes because half the stuff was mostly gothic in nature. Plus there's a limit on certain styles of clothes for women of larger sizes like skirts and tops. Personally I don't think baby mini skirts are appropriate for women that are over the size of 24 with thick waist lines and hips.,4,1,5/20/2009,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,76,185,0

The first room smelled so bad I threw up in my mouth a little bit. I asked them again to honor my reservation and explained we were regular customers and had been for years. They took my phone number and said they would call after talking to the owner. He called me later and said he had been booked for months" before I called and I would have to take a smoking room and he would have his wife change the sheets?This is no way to run a busine",1,6,Update - 5/26/2012,vazTanfeJwjbokWZrGpNzg,124,457,0

Just a brief description of two of the trails. Dogwood a 2.6 mile trail is a nice qualifier to what the rest of the trails at Greensfelder have to offer.  Some really fast flowy single track interrupted by some nice rocky technical sections. Declue trail is 6.7miles technical riding.  The Missouri karst geology means it's nice and rocky/rooty riding with steep climbs and descents. It may not have the penalty for failure" that you find on some of the sections of Chubb but it is still a technical riders trail. I seriously would give this trail a 5 star but as mentioned the equestrians can either make or break your riding experience. 90% of the equestrians I r",4,1,4/10/2012,yb4o3QJhbuLhNlWVeSy-RQ,5,38,0

The rest smell like dirt and tree branches so you might as well just not wash your hair. Lots of other things in Lush also smell like hippies. I have had irritated armpits (seriously) lately and so I thought maybe the aluminum and chemicals in my Secret were the culprit. They have 2 hippy-smelling deodorant bars and one that smells nice. I tried that one. It doesn't work at all but it smells like lemons so it is now a perfume bar. They should label it that way as well. The henna hair dye doesn't do anything.

I go to Sears Auto Center because I get free tire rotations (my tires are under warranty through them). I drove up to the closed door of the bay and waited a few minutes for the door to open. I exited my car and walked around the building to the store part. There was nobody there. A man came out from the back and offered to help me. He ushered me to the garage where they finally opened the door and let me drive in.

It is my favorite one even though the 'downtown' Seattle location may be a little closer as the parking lot seems easier to navigate and the gas station a little easier to get out of as well. The store itself is pretty clean although the layout of each Costco seems to be just a tad bit different from the others. This one has the paper products in the back of the store and a coffee grinder at the front of the store by the food court. You can't go wrong with some of the deals but be weary of the meat department as not all things are 'deals' just because you bought them in bulk.

The waiter came over and  apologized for the hair. However it took forever to get the new burger and once we recieved the bill it was still on there.

It has a mom and pop feel to it and is great for a snack or inexpensive meal when you don't feel like dining from the mass of chain restaurants in the vicinity. The curries available are all out on display so you can point to the most promising looking dish. I can recommend the briyanis and lamb curries. There are onion bhakis and samosas for a quick takeaway snack. There is a small seating area and a little tip is that they show cricket from the sub continent and I've spent some happy times eating curry and watching cricket with the workers.

Dr. Unwalla has been fantastic at finding solutions to my various eye issues over the years - even finding a contact lens I can wear comfortably with my dry eye issues.

All I knew as I was moving here was that Irish people dont know Mexican food and that I would surely starve. I have lived off burritos and tacos my whole life. Thanks to yesterday's visit to Cafe Azteca I am feeling much better about this move. I had a Hugo Jig Burrito which was egg and beans and everything else. I talked with Hugo and he is going to teach me how to make mole next month so I can cook Mexican food at home. He wrote Enjoy" in sour cream on top of my burrito. I am pleased to say I DID enjoy it.

The sign on the door exclaiming FREE ADMISSION" was a slight turn off - I expected it to be a cheap novelty attraction but I was wrong. The Conservatory is a rather large building FULL of plants from around the world and was actually quite interesting.

This i was expecting since we went on a Sunday late afternoon. They have a big bar area and a little waiting area which is rather ingenious if you ask me. Once we got to our table we were taken VERY good care of by our server. I wish I could remember her name because she did a phenomenal job. We stated out with a shrimp and lobster dip.

They had over 30 teams competing but 3/4 of them had chili that tasted bland (some even tasted like they just browned the ground beef and added a chili seasoning mix). I would have preferred Wendy's chili over all but 5 or 6 of them. It was $10 at the door to get a wristband that enabled you to eat as much chili as your heart desired. The best part of the cook-off was the spacewalk. All of the kids were loving it. They also had a mechanical bull and a rock-climbing wall for the older kids and adults. I will probably come back again next year because I live in this parish but am hoping the chili is better than this year's selections.

My only criticism would be the cost/quality of the items in the cafe (which closes a couple of hours before the garden).  $3 for a stale croissant was a bit much. But I guess you're paying for the views too.,5,1,9/29/2012,0Igx-a1wAstiBDerGxXk2A,302,917,0

0LRRUcTqNeyOiQqZixFOWQ,sj6MuZEA5To_lYn2acfaXQ,I made an on-line reservation for dinner on a Tuesday evening in January and received a call to reconfirm that morning. We were the ONLY guests for dinner that evening. The dining room is unusual - kind of an old country store atmosphere with jars and glass wear and old fashioned sighs. It is rustic. Our table was set with a table cloth and was cosey. I ordered the red wine flight - 4 2.5 oz. glasses for $17. I had a large glass of wine for $8 that was a much better value. We shared the arugula & apple salad and the spinach & beet salad. The chef was accommodating and put half of each salad on both plates. My husband loved the arugula salad and I preferred the spinach. Both were very fresh and lightly dressed. The mussels were excellent. They had a very garlicky broth with tarragon and oth,4,1,1/19/2011,sj6MuZEA5To_lYn2acfaXQ,83,293,0

We were passing through on a Sunday afternoon and decided to try this place out for lunch. This place is no more that you your typical small town restaurant but it seems to be very popular with the locals. the service was very flighty for lack of a better term. Our waitress forgot Lara's soup and her milk and the manager forgot to bring me my Heinz 57 steak sauce. I really did not need that sauce because the steak was actually a tasty cut of meat. My steak may have even been a local resident of the surrounding area before I ingested it.  I am thinking my eggs may have been local at one point too as they seemed very fresh.

It took about 5 mins for his order to come up but 30 mins for mine to be called out. Seriously?? The soup wasn't that good (I had the chicken noodle) and my sandwich was just a turkey/cheese.

Unfortunately based upon the crowds that showed up Vancouverites on a Sunday will do almost anything for free cupcakes. Fortunately they had a lot of cupcakes ready to be sliced up and shared with the massive crowds. Unfortunately they used a very small room in the Roundhouse Community Centre that couldn't accommodate the crowds. Fortunately since the room was one of the small side rooms only people who planned to come to this event showed up instead of random groups of people from the street. Unfortunately those dedicated crowds were kind of pushy and shovey (is that a word?) just to get their little 8ths of cupcakes.

You can get fresh salads both veggie and fruit and fresh flatbread sandwiches and pizza with fresh ingredients on it. I also like their make your own pizza option because you can design it the way you like and it's made right. I also came to this place for a first date with my current boyfriend and he loved it so much that last night we had dinner there.

I absolutely love it and the whole thing was 230 calories. Compare that to 600 calories for a small chocolate shake at McDonald's and it's not bad at all! Plus it was cheap...we sent a text while we were in line and got a text back saying we would get 25% off if we showed it to the cashier. Nice! The strange thing is I don't even like yogurt but I love it frozen from Red Mango. They have tons of topping options including a couple different flavored boba balls which is a weird but cool option.

The server said Oh there is a sign in the front that says we aren't taking gift cards..."   Well we looked for the sign and guess what?  It was not on either of the double sets of doors when you walk in.  It was a plain paper sign attached to the cash register.  Now who the hell is looking there when you walk in?  Can somebody say lame??  I can.  LAME!

I needed a pair of good headphones before my upcoming trip as I just lost my old headphones. Though not huge this store does carry all the staple gadgets which other best buy's carry. Customer service can be a hit or miss. On some occasions it took more than 20 mins to get the associate's attention which is not good as more people are moving to shopping online rather than buying in store.

They have yummy snacks and good produce. You should look at their weekly distribution for specials so you can take advantage of their pricing and what's on season. It's not as fancy as wholefoods with cheese and wine selection. Their bulk bin selection for nuts and snacks are really great. Prices are great too.

18GSX8OZyC7naKJiqQ8e6Q,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,What a cool location right on the waterfront of West Seattle. The place itself has more of a restaurant feel than a pizza shop although the service is closer to a pizza shop than a nice restaurant. They have a limited but decent selection of beers to go with your pizza. I ended up going with the house special pizza at the recommendation of the people I was with. It was very densely packed with toppings and was similar to the works pizza at most places except they shred the pepperoni and they put sunflower seeds on it. The shredded pepperoni made it more crunchy and cooked than normal pepperoni which changed the flavor a little than normal pepperoni. The sunflower seeds seemed weird to me as a pizza topping even though love sunflower seeds. They gave the pizza a nutty flavor while being muc,4,1,4/24/2012,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,58,629,0

Our table also had some smoked turkey but it was too salty for anyone to eat thus minus one star plus the banana pudding was really far from being the southern classic" it was touted to be.

We have obtained mortgages from the bank and also have used their trust department - they are very professional.  My family and I also have our checking and other deposit accounts with Palos.   If you prefer to sit down with real people who won't take advantage of you - go to Palos Bank.  If you prefer bankers who will push your grandma to an annuity salesman when she thinks she is buying a C.D. - go to most national banks.,5,4,9/5/2009,4ssDCBvb9LC2cMpWxjhpRQ,26,185,0

I feel like they could have had better menu choices. I got the Maui- Maui with a side of rice and vegetables. The Maui-Maui was tender and full of flavor. With that being said the drinks were good and it was a good time with my girlfriends. I would probably give Elephant Bar another chance since it has been awhile since I have ate their.

My wife's noodle dish (I forget which one) was tasty as well. Service was attentive and quick and the only thing they could possibly do to make the visit better is to get some Mekong whiskey.

One of our group was very apprehensive of getting on a Segway but both April and Freddie our guides were very patient and helpful. They watched and worked with all of us to make sure we were comfortable and ready. April even went with us on half the tour to make sure that everyone was ok. The tour was about 9 miles. Freddie was a great fun and informative guide who knew the city and it's history. Steve's is a little hard to find so follow this instructions closely.

The martini has the same colors and taste as it's name sake - but with the added kick of vodka ;)   The Chinese part of their menu is pretty good.  Their fried rice looks more like plain brown rice than any fried rice I've ever had though.  Items like beef and broccoli are drowned in the usual suspect sauce.  Their sushi is nice but serving size is rather small compar,3,0,4/8/2011,dk5yqirSwDH7Cpp52NdhUA,35,302,0

A quick search on Esquire Magazine's Best Bars in America revealed 2 best bars in Columbus. Surly Girl (located in the Short North area) being one of them. Eclectic decor with a funky vibe. Skulls abound. Cool candelier hangs above the entry way. 3 people were there when we arrived..........but within 1 hour the place was packed. Very nice beer selections (both draught and bottle). Went with the Bells's Two Hearted Ale and also some sort of Belgian. At first glance the menu revealed nothing unique until I found a listing for Pasole (pazole?).... the homey & hearty hominy Mexican soup. Great find that I highly recommend.

It was nice to converse with a fellow paison. Since I wasn't totally starving I just had some apps. The anti-pasto for 2 and a plain pizza is all we needed. Plus a bottle of wine. The food was quite enjoyable and it was nice to have a fun and lighthearted conversation with the staff. The antipasto was great. The pizza was no NY/NJ style but still managed to hit the spot.

If you are a big fan of pho you are in luck cuz for $12 dollars the carnitas caldos is a really good substitute if the potato dumplings were replaced for rice noodles.

1e1BXBHGtuhnC_PjcOnXRA,puUP7otIJotqTI-MCt3xWg,My frist visit to Teddy's !! I was pretty psyched to go here since I've driven past it a few times and have usually seen the parking lot packed on the weekends. This is your average bar with a dance floor thats on the smaller side and a decent amount of tables and plasmas on the wall. The drinks are pricey for what you actually get. My crown and Coke seem extremely watered down and so did the Jack. Sunrise senior living is right down the street and I think Teddy's is definitely the fav hang out spot. There are tons of cougars (not necessary the ones you would dream about) and tons of guys to take home the cougars. If your bored and don't feel like staying in the Shelby Twp are hit it up and make sure you bring your AARP card along ;),3,0,3/8/2010,puUP7otIJotqTI-MCt3xWg,34,128,0

The first thing that caught my eye was the garbage bag on the urinal with a sign that looked like someone peed on it. So I go to was my hands and there is a large bottle of hair gel where the soap dispenser used to be? Not even going to try it. Back at the table we ordered shrimp spring rolls and crab meat rangoons. The rolls were very much something on a diet plate. Light as a feather. But I would need 30 more to even begin to make a dent and not a whole lot of flavor. The Rangoons were probably the best I have tasted and quite large. I had the number 78. Beef and vegetables with white rice. Lots of flavor and healthy portitions for the inexpensive price.

Although I do get rather annoyed when I have to wait for someone in front of me who is ordering a Bud Light in a bottle. If your going to drink that crap at least have the decency to not clog up the best bar in Boston while doing so. I mean seriously you can get that stuff anywhere and for a hell of a lot cheaper elsewhere. I suppose that's the price of it being located in Kenmore. That said one of the under rated and most overlooked aspects of ES is their beer selection. I can honestly say I had never ordered a beer or even thought about it until I went to a Pretty Things event.

If Wal-Mart made Guiness this would be it. On to the food. I had the house burger with three kinds of mushrooms and two cheeses with caramelized onions. Sounded good. But it didn't translate at all. The cheese was hard and not melted? The whole burger was about luke warm. The special sauce tasted like watered down ketchup. The french fries were the best part of the meal. They were over cooked the way I like-um. But I didn't ask for them to be that way. At 10 bucks a pop for a burger and fries I,2,0,12/2/2007,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,356,927,0

He could have been more personable and he did seem to be going through the motions. For starters we ordered the Crab-Stuffed Mushrooms. They were delicious and came topped with this yummy sauce. The appetizers are all rather pricey for what you get ($10-$17). For our entrees my friend ordered the Shrimp and Grits. I went with the New York Strip based on Frank's recommendation. I tried my friend's dish and we both agreed that the grits were really firm. I am used to creamy grits. They tasted good though. The shrimp were tasty but small. My steak (ordered medium rare) was not cooked as requested. It came out more towards a medium doneness. ,2,3,6/12/2012,DAeC-Y66n-jNMJJw4oAfNQ,103,294,0

I find the burritos bland the last few times I was here.  I've tried all of the burritos and the carne and pulled pork were at one time pretty decent.  The only thing that is annoying is they can't make a burrito for a size properly.  Depending on who's working your large might end up as the same size as my medium and that's no big deal for me but I know some people get annoyed when they pay the difference only to get a burrito pretty muc,2,1,12/1/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

Sat down in the spa pedicure chair and turned on the massage part of the chair. Nice. Soaked for a bit in the (as the previous reviewer said) tub that lights into different colors. Pretty cool. I upgraded to a signature spa pedicure after my nail tech took a look at my feet and suggested it would help considering how dry and flaky my heels were. The decor in there is truly regal. There is plenty of room in there that you don't feel like you are sitting in your neighbor's lap. Clean and a great atmosphere.

1tmi2m_HsEW2htjl1YpttQ,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,This is a nice little joint which I feel is a mix of a dive bar and a karaoke place. When we walked in on Thursday evening there was no cover to get in but they usually have $10 bucks as cover charge on the weekends. This place is divided into two section with upstairs being the bar and downstairs can be a karaoke lounge or some band might be playing depending on the day of the week. They have different bands playing all the time so check the schedule before going in.Can't comment on drinks since we didn't drink here. The bouncer on the door was cool.

Once we entered the store we were greeted by a very friendly employee who was able to answer all of her questions. We were in and out of the store within 15 minutes and my boyfriend's mother was very happy. The only thing I would have added to the store was to their selection of products. There were't that many phones and accessories on display making the store seem a bit bare. Overall...great service!,3,0,10/5/2011,dC5kYsLGGoLLVlMjeMqfLw,21,451,0

The food is ok but the prices are great! under 6bucks for a footlong and you put whatever toppings you want on it. They also have a punch card once you hit 10 the next sandwich is free. Subxpress really reminds me of jimmy johns. One thing I wish they would do is offer to toast the sandwich or make it warm because everything is served cold most of the time i end up microwaving the sandwiches before I eat it. Other than that its a great lunch place if you are lazy or too busy to leave the office. They also offer soup and br,3,2,8/15/2012,fPzM8rESloa6Leh0Ye7D5A,12,124,0

When I visited they didn't really have any specials and the A/C wasn't working - which I can understand because it's new and probably froze up.  We were mostly outside anyways.   I plan to revisit in the coming months when they're more established.,3,1,7/16/2010,HcUELjJ3-krjLXvLqUdjBQ,12,107,0

While not exactly in a picturesque location (a giant parking lot right next to the highway offramp) it is super convenient to 190 and had plenty of parking. The ice cream more than made up for this. I had the Graham Meola flavor which was awesome. The ice cream was graham flavored and not overly laced with cinnamon or other spices with chunks of chocolate that taste like pieces of Crispy Aero bars.

The bagels were solid and nailed the essential crispy-to-soft ratio. The nova and cream cheese on top were perfect and very fresh. The totally unnecessary spinach knish that I got also was pretty bland. The employees here exist on two very opposite ends of a spectrum. Half do not speak English well and are not familiar with the basics of bagelry. The other half are 900 years old and are so excessively Jewish as to be ridiculous.

The lady thinks about it for a few seconds - then tells me "there is one of them fancy coffee shops right before the interstate." Wondering what I would find - I head back the way I came - lo and behold - it's a friggin' Starbucks! I laughed to myself - wondering what response I would have gotten back at White Castle had I asked for Starbucks by name. This one is a little hard to get into - there is only one entrance to the parking lot as far as I could see - and there is a lot of traffic going to the Interstate.

We come here for the ok priced beer with a large group of friends.  I'd bypass the food. I've eaten at some sketchy places over the years but had to put the food down on a sharing platter down because I found the food way to greasy.  My friends had the same opinion.

20kGM4VIIAwufIBpT8tDCA,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,So close... I agree with Vera's this place is one of the better places in Ottawa for bagels and is definitely better than Kettleman's.  The bagels are also $1each if you get them uncut and you can get multiple at a discount!  It's $4.50 for 6 bagels. Most of the bagels are nice.  The spicy one kind of sucks.  If you want a MTL style bagel this place is as close as you're going to get without making a trip out to  Fairmont West or St-Viateur West.  It's not quite as good but damn close. I have tried some of their other items and they're ok.  My only gripe with this place is that I wish they would separate the day old bagels vs fresh ones!,4,0,2/16/2012,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

22hOkJtYeS1EhrCJroBT-w,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I have been coming to this Polyclinic location for the past 5 years or so; primarily due to working 'downtown'. A few things I love: You don't have to see 'your' doctor. If you have an emergency or  need to be squeezed in; you can see another doctor and get a fairly quick appointment. Free wifi in the lobby so that you can work (if you need to) while you wait. Which we all know can be a while when you're at a doctor's appointment. They now offer electronic charts online for your medical history. I haven't logged in to activate it yet but it is nice to be able to print/review your old medical files. A few things I dislike: No validated parking. This assumes you 'still' work downtown and/or you don't mind to pay $6/hr to park downtown. They always are running behind.

There is an end cap on one aisle that has a selection of single-wrapped bar soaps for about 50 cents apiece. They come in beautiful asian-print papers and scents like jasmine and green tea. They are the perfect little gift if you put a bunch in a basket or as a decorative extra to a bigger gift. They also sell great dishware like porcelain plate sets and clay saki sets (small pitcher with cups) for under $15. I sent one to a friend for Christmas and she raved for weeks about how expensive it looked! Honestly I've never tried any of the food products sin,4,3,5/28/2008,h51H-UsPhZgmPkdsjqz68g,72,379,0

They had a beautiful bouquet already prepared and were honest about the quality of some of the other stuff they had.   The price is reasonable for what you get.

Black Finn is supposed to be a chic lounge/bar for the contemporary man/woman in the mid to late 20s but it serves as a den for older folks like wise. My most recent visit to Black Finn was on a rainy saturday night. My buddy and I hauled ass from the parking lot to the club to avoid be overly drenched by the rain but to our surprise there was a line outside and the guys at the door refused to let anyone in the foyer aka we all got super wet which in turn means we're pissed off. The Bar: Once we paid the $5 cover and got it foyer its going to take you another 10 mins to walk to the bar since this place is packed to the max. There is barely any room to breathe and you have to forcefully push your way through the crowd to make to either the bar right at the front d,3,3,4/27/2010,puUP7otIJotqTI-MCt3xWg,34,128,1

I got food from here many times while staying at the hotel and it was always tasty to me. They have the Disney classics like chicken nuggets and fries which are seriously amazing chicken nuggets! They serve an African stew in a bread bowl which was yummy and unique to Mara. They serve different types of flatbreads which is a nice change from other resort food. Their brownies has an animal paw print on them...Awwww! You can also get Zebra domes here which I know many people are fans of. I recommend Mara for a quick bite at Animal Kingdom if you're staying there or hanging out at their pools. I wouldn't recommend driving over just for Mara though!

2cdQn0GwtzvwMyKzWVZxlA,DAeC-Y66n-jNMJJw4oAfNQ,First time here was last thursday with a couple of friends. After only one visit me and my friends are hooked. You gotta love good slow cooked brisket. The perfect brisket is all about the right cut of beef and cooking it slow and low. If you have the time to cook your brisket for 6 hrs at 250 degrees that would be ideal and it seems like they definitely cooked their brisket slow and low. The ribs and brisket here are the best I've ever had. The baked beans that I ordered were simply out of this world...I could eat buckets of it everyday!!! It's that good. Anyone know how they make it? :),5,2,3/27/2011,DAeC-Y66n-jNMJJw4oAfNQ,103,294,1
2CkYvtEoNtokwFMiyQlIUw,TxkL_XV9EwygBIXiuW6kvQ,I was driving back from Wyoming to Denver and pulled over at this restaurant for lunch.  The restaurant was mostly empty since it was almost 1pm.  They sat me immediately.  I ordered the reuben and a side salad.  The side salad came with a lot of different topping which I wasn't expecting but did enjoy.  The reuben was fine but the dressing was way too sweet.  I'm glad that I asked for it on the side.  Also had the iced tea that was fresh.   Over all it was a good experience.  I do have to say I think it is gross that they cook chicken in the front of the restaurant and there is no protective screen between the rotisserie and the public.  I hope they don't use that food.  I can't imagine how many people either cough or touch that meat.  I would never order chicken here.

When I think I Bojangles it is purely for the Dirty Rice. Is there a better tasting side dish in the fast food world? I don't think so. I also think about their Legendary Sweet Tea.

The room was very large and I am a sucker for any hotel with large windows. The decor was random with orange and gray and a very ugly bathroom. WIFI will cost you $10 a day and still have a poor signal. The restaurant downstairs was open (c-house) but I did not get the chance to try it. I would have but after terrible service from staff I'd most likely go elsewhere. I ran downstairs after work on a weekday and sat right next to Anthony Bourdain without even realizing it at first.

I perused the menu and saw that they served falafel.  The wife being a vegetarian is always down for some falafel and I am a bit of a gyro fanatic. First thing that came to mind when we entered the restaurant was that it had the ambiance of a re-purposed Subway sandwich shop.  I also noticed that their online menu stated they had fries but the in-store menu only offered bags of Lays potato chips or an apple for their sides. I went ahead ordered a gyro sandwich for myself and a falafel sandwich for the wife. Imagine the look of  horror on my face when  the girl behind the counter dished some precooked gyro meat that was swimming in water out of ,1,1,9/6/2012,yb4o3QJhbuLhNlWVeSy-RQ,5,38,0
2GYYnW60QPUldPN7gg5ZEQ,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,Tiny little drug store.  It hasn't adapted like it's larger counter parts (Shoppers and Pharma Plus) but it focuses on being a pharmacy first and the customer service here is fantastic. You won't wander more than 2 minutes until someone realizes you need help.  However the store is pretty small and you should be able to find what you're looking for in 2 minutes. It has all the basics of a drug store and a pharmacy in back.  It's a throw back to friendly community stores from your child hood.,3,0,8/10/2012,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

I was here with a rather large group and they were very attentive to us since we were spending a lot of money.  I am a huge fettucinne alfredo fan and it did not dissappoint me here. We only had one main problem when they were clearing our tables.  The busboys were whizzing around so fast that they spilled leftovers on the person's back who was sitting next to me.  The busboy saw it and hightailed into the back room.  Needless to say my friend was furious.  We tried to clean her up the best we could with napkins and cold water.  It was at this time that we were completely ignored when we tried to get someones attention.  We finally told a waitress who told a manager and he acted almost offended that we would accuse his employee of doing something of this natur,3,3,10/18/2006,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,1

I have to admit that the single bathroom and the dirty hippy deciding that breastfeeding in a 15 person dining room as she sat down was a great idea - really got me off on the wrong foot here. The plantains were mediocre and small compared to other cuban fair I have eaten. The rice was nothing special and the meat was just average.

I am a big fan of yogurt - i really liked this - Eggplant with walnuts dish - i love eggplants but somehow this dish really didnt do much for me. ** all with warm fresh bread - it was fantastic! The entrees - generous giant portions all come with side veggies and rice. Lots of kebab style dishes to choose from and they were all hits across the table. I tried the Dizi which was a fantastic choice - the most different pick on the menu but so great!

During the week they run a number of different specials/events including; Karoake and Trivia.  The Wednesday night trivia group is the best.  Drinks are only 2 bucks (yes almost everything in the place) and pizza's are 5 bucks for a large cheese (1 dollar per additional topping).   The staff is the bomb!

First visit was to get a new hard drive installed and the guy told me that I didn't need one? I get home and called someone else and they told me I needed a new hard drive. But it would take a week. Back to the store and spoke to another guy. He understood and told me it would be taken care of ASAP! Right! 3 days later I get a call. I asked the associate if this was all I needed or was there something else. Nope.

They are remodeling this hotel but I'm not positive that it will help. When we got to the 8th floor and stepped off the elevator I instantly knew something was amok. The hallway looked awful and that's an understatement. I just kept telling myself they were remodeling. The room itself was not bad but small. The bathroom was very cramped. We needed to get a card for the wedding and were told by the hotel staff that a driver would take us to CVS. Our wedding was at 7:00 and this was 6:00ish.

The Chef made the cooking look so simple and elegant and was also cracking some funny quotes in between his cooking.As soon the chef finished cooking everybody was offered to taste small sampling of the Risotto.

2tVicXW2Iht_zPqOIOniMg,qmjoMFMZdLH69_6eGTGDZw,This place was so much fun! You board the train and they take you out a little way and stop and then they go backwards through the haunted forest". Somehow they make it sound like something is hitting the top of the train car. They play creepy music and have ghouls lurking through out the train scaring people. That's their purpose and sometimes little ones don't like that. In a case on our train the ghoul took his mask off so the little kid who was crying hysterically could see he was just a person in a mask. My 6 year old really wanted to go through the haunted train car which doesn't move. They have about 8 feet of an inflatable thing that is really hard to get through and it freaked her out so we decided not to go through it. She really wanted to so we got back in line.

2zEWg50Mq95heTYtFiuMog,J6PrksAcbjitDZrINPrQjQ,This is a fun place to enjoy a nice meal.  They give you some options when ordering pasta.  You can get two kinds if you want (for instance lasagne and spaghetti on the same plate) or two kinds of sauces (alfredo and meat sauce mixed together if you please...)  The turtle ice cream dessert is very good.  I also enjoyed the caesar salad with sliced chicken.  Mmmmm!  You will get a kick out of the streetcar sitting in the middle of the room (you can ask to eat inside it) as well as the fun decorations and stuff on the walls.,4,0,7/11/2005,J6PrksAcbjitDZrINPrQjQ,377,626,0
2ZjG2Gx8ivgWh252nW1VOw,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,Why do I love this place?  Because even though I live 250 miles away they treat me like I am a regular customer.  I signed up for their mailing list about 5 years ago and every year they send me a catalog. Ok a catalog I am sure you are thinking Big Deal.  Most times about 10-30 days after I recieve the catalog they called me to see if there was anything I might want to order!  Of course I had to order something!  This really impressed me.  Oh did I mention that their fudge is out of this world!  I think that this may be the best in the Dells!

2ZK-0xmN2lmPUqguB_dP3w,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,Pretty decent for a Costco. The staff I have come across seems friendly. I can even tolerate the Boulder Moms and their parking lot (bad) driving. The food court is decent.

2znliyxylr5S8RuJMqJn1A,5mFtCLdzwGCnalxod1Ox9g,I have to disagree with the previous reviewer.  This place is great.  I find the quality of the food to be just the same as the Dodge location (i have not been to the one way west because I hate West Omaha).  The characters that work here sometimes look a bit sketchy but it just adds to the kitsch of this place.  The pizza and calzones are great.,5,3,1/29/2007,5mFtCLdzwGCnalxod1Ox9g,125,231,0

2_ltPoOnm4E16WeQlpHrbw,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,They recently updated the mall and the store was dragged with it. The food items are a frickin mess like most HG's. I was standing by an associate stocking the shelves and noticed her pilling the stuff in no apparent order. And I thought it was the customers who did this. But they always have something you didn't know you needed and I didn't have to wait a half hour to pay like at the Tinley store.,4,2,9/26/2011,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,356,927,0
2_xSY33zQf4ASEntLzzhwA,Amc7J0F3KeAKzOOQrlpqog,OK first off I will give it 3 stars because they were busy so the crappy service was probably because of that. (It's was Mother's Day brunch.) Their brunch is pretty pricey and they were constantly out of food except waffles. Waffles? Really? I was expecting more breakfast Mexican type food. Their Sopas were blah and tamales were nothing to write home about. My husband went here another evening and had the carna asada and flautas and they were delicious.

They are very professional and always fast with orders. Their menu selection is huge. Plus they load the sandwich like a sandwich should be loaded.

I am glad they opened one close by to Plano as I am tired of driving to Dallas for Torchy's or driving to Austin for that matter. I was here to introduce my brother to their tacos. We shared the queso and I got the fried avocado and street corn. He got the Democrat and Brushfire. He is not a Torchy's lover. One thing that I like about this location is the patio area. It is roomy and very shaded. I also like the service we received. We had several food runners that helped us all throughout our dining experience here. I recommend eating the tacos with corn tortilla. I think corn tortilla gives you a feed of old school tacos with a modern twist of Torchy's.

I was a little bubbly to find that the air conditioning was by one of those large window units below the main window.     It was little humid in there but that dropped it down and I used up enough electricity keeping my room cool as anyone.....   Sigh....     I would have to say that this is one of the best hotels in Oklahoma City.

The panoramic views are beautiful although there are layers of smog that hinder some of the allure. People and pup watching is at a premium and quite enjoyable as you huff and puff your way through the trail. Runyon is very dog friendly with dogs allowed to run leash-free. The pup to human ratio is quite staggering. I am a massive animal lover and enjoyed being surrounded by my furry friends. Loved the stand of snacks and beverages that was completely based on the honor system" for payment and the complimentary yoga class.

The theatre was a good size and the aisles and the seats were big enough for a tall guy like me to sit comfortably. This was a huge bonus for me.

Love the new location! It's several miles farther down U.S. 29 South than the previous location!  It's in between the intersection of Vint Hill Road/U.S. 29 and beautiful downtown New Baltimore proper!

I was pinching myself when I saw the lobby of this beautiful hotel. I could not believe this was where I was staying during my vacation that i got for such an affordable price under $99. This hotel reminds me of other  Historic hotels in New Orleans but with updated Guest Bedrooms. The hotel had car dropoff and cab pickup that i thought was very convenient cuz ive been staying at hotels in other cities that sadly did not offer that service. I stayed on the 9th floor and had a view of the Park :) I would happily stay here again next time im planning a trip to San Antonio.,4,4,2/3/2012,DejbySADs66NO3RMAuzBIw,15,103,0

The Airport was designed and built quite a long time ago and really needs some updates - it was built 45 years ago - those updates are happening now. Construction on the underground AeroTrain system continues and is scheduled to open some time in 2009. The AeroTrain will replace those mobile lounges that look like they came straight out of that old scifi TV show - Space 1999!

I see Jamie and I've gotten more compliments in the 2 years I have seen her than in the past 28 years of my life P.J. (pre-Jamie). She is easy to talk to (and takes no offense when I bring work or a magazine) does exactly as requested (even during awkward growing out stages she manages to honor my request while also making my hair look like something that belongs on a human with a 9-5) and does a great job matching hair color to skin-tone.

I've been to quite a few but this one wasn't great and that makes me wonder if the chain will age well. Most Hyatt Places are new right now. The hotel had some peeling paper which is characteristic of older hotels. But probably my biggest complaint of all was the cool to cold showers. For the first few days the water just wasn't very hot. The last day of my stay the water was barely usable it was so cold. No one seemed to know why. That's not comforting for a regular traveler. A few restaurants are within walking distance and the highway is very close so the location is good for business around Lombard.,3,0,7/5/2010,rij-5iD4iU3VVTn9-pWeHQ,64,198,0

Their were so many sauce choices it was almost overwhelming. I opted for a delicious peanut sauce. Shortly after leaving the bowls at the grill my meal was dropped off at the table. It can be a little pricey but in reality you can go overboard on the veggies and meat. My wife and I both took home another meal each from our left overs.,4,0,2/15/2012,6Jopvq1K9PtrqBaXt2ZdaQ,3,25,0

3pOP-ThyvS-YIHivcwoIRw,42P_hSlGg0Lgj6wl9-eDjw,I love Kimptons but the Donovon House needs just a little fine tuning to give it that 4 or 5 star it definitely can be. PROS: - $100 hotwire rate was scored and they offered us to add on another night for only $4 more. This was a GREAT deal especially considering we got upgraded 3 room categories and ended up with a King Premiere. - Kimpton intouch member so we scored free wifi (and it works!) and $10 on the mini bar. - On Sunday this locations surroundings are very quiet but Monday it's a completely different world. All the cafes and shops open and it's such a different vibe. While it's not that close to stuff you can walk. We walked back from Georgetown once and Dupont Circle is a easy walk. - Bed was comfortable as was the room overall. - When issues arrived they were easy to solve. - F,3,0,9/27/2012,42P_hSlGg0Lgj6wl9-eDjw,11,177,0

The place is open across the street from Giant Tiger on Wellington and parking can be a pain to find. Walking into the restaurant you can see the oven and you notice it's a pretty small place.  I think there's less than a dozen tables. The staff quickly took our numbers and had us at a table within a minute.  The menu looks pretty good from top to bottom but there are a few items that stand out for me. I ordered the charcuturie and Elmdale pizza.  The appetizer was amazing with all kinds of duck.  The pate was the best part of the appetizer.  I have tried this again on my second and third time back and it's still really good.

The room was clean and well appointed with a nice flat panel TV.  The bathroom is good size and the beds were comfortable.

3zUPQTpCRkZKOF06WoPc1Q,DKr_qJHG7S6CoSd-Qv4BuQ,This whole place is just not what you want out of a hotel. I really felt like I was at a motel 6 or a best western. There really wasn't anything distinctly Hilton like that this place provided other than the channel that's on the TV which reminds you every time that you turn it on that you are at a Hilton property. The whole thing that this place lacks are the amenities that you want out of a hotel you're paying a lot of money for. The beds are fine but I don't think that they really intend for business people to stay here very long. Oh and it's a crapshoot to find the right entrance.,2,2,11/23/2008,DKr_qJHG7S6CoSd-Qv4BuQ,0,69,1

The beertender (also one of the owners) lifted the table and voila all the balls appeared. *Great conversation on the recent OSU football problems. *Great conversation on college football overall. *Asked if beertender/owner had ever met Terrel Pryor and he had. he noted that the listed 6 foot 6 inch Pryor was no more than 6 foot 2 inches and probably 210 at the most.

The only thing I can say is get there early (maybe a half hour) and drink lots of water. I went to see Flaming Lips there in July and there was no AC. My boyfriend and I were standing near the stage but had to move upstairs before the band even started playing. It was extremely hot and I felt dehydrated and dizzy.

They have an amazing breakfast buffet in a beautiful space. I can also recommend the Restaurant for dinner - it is like I image fine dining was in the 1920's or 1930's - its definitely an experience - formal and uber professional.

The chicken stock was obviously from scratch and was full of flavor. The cheese was a little different type than usuall and went with the broth very well. The chicken was tender which is not ways the case with tortilla soup. I would recommend getting the tortillas on the side so they don't get soggy.

I don't like Mexican food and wasn't planning on eating anything but decided to get a kid's meal of Cheese Quesadilla. The lines were pretty long although they move pretty quickly. It is similar to a Subway type setup where someone else moves your food along and finishes the 'toppings'. The older guy working the order counter was quick and funny but he did forget my quesadilla and so it was a bit on the 'crispy' side and hard to eat.

Price - great package compared to $60 for just pedicures at other salons. 2. Ambience - its a cute little place. So you wont get the serene zen like spa experience here - there are plenty of other places in the city with handomse price tags for those. - massage chairs that face flat screen tvs with great movies playing all the time. 3. Perks: - candy - many different kinds - at the dryer stations - if they are slow they have no problems with you staying back and waiting until you are dry and ready to leave - FREE SMOOTHIES AND TEA BAR **such a treat** they bring a menu for you once you settle in 4.

When we walked into The Exchange the place was about half to 3/4 full.  A hostess came out and asked how many we had which we told her two.  She told us it'd be a minute as they needed a table to clear up.  Ummm sure no problem.  Like I said the place was at best 3/4 full.  A family came in after which the same server acknowledge and then took them to a table immediately.  My friend gave me that look like What was THAT?" and I just said if we aren't seated in 2 minutes we'll go to Milestones.  Another hostess came by and asked if we had a seat which we said no and then she sat us immediately.

49OFIJwx8erbLG5AnhQE9A,jgPOl8penY4km_zdEYRAhg,We were in Zillah for some wine tasting and someone referred us to Creekside West for dinner.  It was a Saturday about 7pm and we were able to walk right in and find a comfy seat in the bar area.  We ordered the Asian nachos and steak skewers to start with.  The nachos were really yummy.  It was a nice blend of flavors.  The steak skewers were so tender.  The appetizers had us really excited for dinner. My husband ordered the lamb and I had the steak.  My steak was so unbelievably tender.  It's almost like you could cut it with your fork.  It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus with a creamy Gorgonzola sauce. We will definitely be back when we're in the area.  If anything for the Happy Hour appetizers.,4,2,7/9/2012,jgPOl8penY4km_zdEYRAhg,10,169,0

Kettleman's bagels are a Montreal style bagel that doesn't hit the spot like a Montreal bagel and doesn't seem to hold as long as a Montreal bagel.

It wasn't too busy (Sat early afternoon). We seem to have beat the crowds. I am a big 'portion' girl where I eat more frequently but not as big of portions. I had a hard time as so much food came out. I do like that you can get the sauce on the side so you don't have to have things coated with BBQ sauce. The cornbread was good although I wasn't too impressed with the ribs. I should disclaim though that I usually prefer beef ribs & they had pork only. They did claim to have free wifi if you used the code off your receipt but I was never able to get it to work for me.,3,0,4/26/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

We opted to go with Willow Creek as it seemed fairly busy and two girls had burgers from there that were the size of pancakes. I figured for the price you paid that it looked like a decent amount of food. I ordered a burger (which came with fries) and my husband ordered a hot dog. Our total meal came to about $20 with 2 sodas as well (refillable). The burger came with a sesame bun which was a nice change from a sad bun that had nothing on it.

So we were looking for a kitschy tiki themed bar that was open late night after deciding to not to go to the LUPEC event because we were running so terribly late. So we rounded up some friends and tried out the bar. We had a great time and ended up staying till close. First off I have to say the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for. The giant Polynesian mural on the wall was awesome. I also really liked the layout of the bar with lots of small tables and funky leather chairs on wheels. The only disappointment was that only one drink came in a cheesy glass. The rest were in typical barware. The drinks were tall and very strong and about $6 each. So I was sold.

I just wish I could swirl the two flavors.  I added the cookie batter chunks to this mixture. I have also had the original tart and pomegranate flavors mixed which was awesome as well. I added some freshly diced fruit to this. Yum! An it was only 35 cents an ounce. Cheaper than other fro to places.

They are family owned and operated and you can really tell how much love and care goes into the wine and the business as a whole. We decided to join their wine club here our first time visiting not just because the wine is great ( though it is) but because they throw pick up parties at the winery when the shipments are available.

4EWzCbm_XBSunvvNMmocYA,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,My 400th review...woo hoo! My gf and I were in the area from a previous engagement and we were both in the mood for some good seafood. This place came up tops on many people's list we had spoken to. We decided to try. We got their early so there wasn't much of a wait. We sat down outside and had a good view of the water. We glanced over the menu and I had to try their NE Clam Chowder to start out. It was good but I have had better. It was a bit watery than I am used to although there was a good amount of clam which made up for it. For a meal I went with the crab-cake sandwich. Too much bread and not enough crab cake. Then in between more bread made it too much. My gf had the salmon which she enjoyed. Their prices are on par with other seafood places we had been to down the shore.

They serve more seafood but we were in the mood for chicken. I had the Enfrioladas which were chicken enchiladas with blackbean sauce and chorizo. My friend had the chicken breast dish. We were told that the blue crab enchiladas may not be the best in the menu because it lacks flavor based on everyone's feedback.

4kBcEnX0aOMNLvkmHPxJJw,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,* I must have had a lucky day * Based upon all the negative reviews of this location I imagine I just had a very lucky day.  I needed to pick up a few small items and found this CVS connected to the conference centre via a series of air conditioned walkways (which were really appreciated in the ridiculous heat wave!).   I was greeted at the door by a very friendly man that worked there.  He was extremely chatty.  There were several cash registers operating and even though they each had a line they moved really quickly.   The cashier was once again friendly and seemed efficient.   I notice all of the negative reviews are from back in 2008.  Maybe they had a management change?  Or maybe I just got REALLY lucky?   Perhaps I should have bought a lottery ticket!!!!,4,5,8/11/2009,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,0

They were incredibly patient with me (not knowing anything about flowers or arrangements) and they worked with me to create center pieces that I liked. I actually changed them three (yes THREE!) times before the wedding. Each time they were incredibly patient and understanding and helpful. The prices were GREAT - and they created stunning centerpieces and a beautiful arrangement for our place card table.

I have been here on St Patty's when the place is completely mobbed  and it seemed so much bigger (especially the tent outside). You do get a lot younger crowd.

(Although they changed it since December now it's build your own and doesn't have the same peppers =( ) And my favorite is the pretzel crusted chicken. So yum and to die for. They only serve it after 4:30 or 5 though. I was bummed because I didn't know that little piece of information and had to settle for the pulled pork sandwich (which was still fabulous.)

They sell items for your pantry and carry a few hot sauces.  I am trying to find out if the hot sauce they have here is the hot sauce that is used by The Manx because it's a very good sauce. The produce looks really fresh but seems almost twice the price of local Ottawa produce you can get in the Byward Market that's 2 blocks away. They have a kitchen that serves food here.  I asked for a recommendation between the charcuterie cone (sample a handle of their deli meats) or a few specials they had that day.  I was told that I should try the steak sandwich as that was definitely the best,2,0,7/17/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

We were rained out of Hollywood Studios and hopped to Epcot for dinner. I'm sure it may have been different if it wasn't pouring rain the entire time but we walked past Canada and London and tried to have dinner in Italy. We were turned away stating it was reservation only. We walked back to Japan and tried to have dinner at one of the steakhouses there. We were rudely told that it would take an hour minimum and handed a pager. I'm unsure if it's because we were soaking wet (it had been raining for hours outside) or why we were getting the cold treatment. We ended up being seated faster than we expected due to a table needing a party of 2 to fill out the table. I'm from Seattle where ther,3,0,4/25/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,1

It was a little chilly along the banquet but not enough to make me want to move. The restaurant itself is really quite stylishly designed with an a contemporary feel with a river bed running through the centre with a large golden asian statue fronting it.

4qUf76AqMJN5jl7T2Kiqmg,kMsX9ZxCfwgjZDEdCDej9Q,Well..Sunday found me at O'Hare in Terminal B and my gate was right next to Tortas Frontera. And I am flying to Mexico City. Coincidence? Doubtful. I am sure that Mr. Bayless strategically placed his restaurant in the going to Mexico" departure area. This time I went with the Shrimp Torta. Seared shrimp with chipotle garlic sauce with black beans and strips of poblano. Melt some goat cheese top it off with arugula and put it on some toasted crunchy bread and you have something I call Torta Heaven. Very filling..... so if you have someone to share with I recommend. Especially at breakfast time. Stupid me got a coffee. I should have went with one of the "jugos" or "liquiados". Now I am sitting on the Zocalo in Mexico City where the tortas are 1/10th the price.

Anyways back to Riverstone Grill.  We came here for the bone in the stone.  It's a ribeye steak that is 32-60oz that sits on top of 10oz of fries and another 10 oz of sweet potato fries covered in blue cheese and onion strings.  I'm pretty sure my heart missed a few beats when I read it and that the time to cut into it ,3,4,12/29/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

After we were seated we were served by a waiter with big assed 1970's sunglasses (the old Porsche style).  He was right on the money with recommendations and his service.  I got the Eggs Benedict (nothing to do with the Pope) and it was prepared perfectly.  The yolks were runny but the whites were perfect as was the rest of the dish.  I would definitely recommend this place.",4,2,7/18/2008,bXmJD9Xcr8H1wgIkjC1Blw,119,320,0

4X42EKnSLFofO0WgEINbBQ,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I was visiting in Williamsburg for the weekend & found Francesco's in a google search. We drove out of our way to come eat because I was craving Italian food. The 'lunch' crowd wasn't very busy as there was one small group (4 ppl) in the restaurant besides us. Our waitress didn't seem very interested in taking our orders or in making sure our meal was served promptly. We had to ask for our breadsticks which came with our meals. Both waitresses were seen in the back of the restaurant on their cell phones (texting) as well as gossiping with each other. There's nothing like bad wait staff to ruin a meal.,2,2,4/25/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

Took a seat at the bar omg its the longest bar ive ever seen i think the Bartender Aaron told me it seats 35 peeps? Took a look at the menu which was a small clipboard? and decided on Canary Island Ice Pick cocktail some crawfish croquettas and blue crab bisque. The cocktail was great i had 2. The crawfish croquettas were amazing maybe the best appetizers ive ever tried. I cant believe at happy hour they are only .50 cents?? I like that it seemed like they used dong phuong bread but it wasnt hot :( My least fav dish was the soup it was more of a cream of crab bisque cuz their wasnt much crab.

I am African American and upon Walking in the restaurant there were several waiters/hostesses at the counter. Several seconds past before I was even acknowledged. Note: I'm 6'3 finally a host took me to my seat. He took me to the black section apparently. I sat close to 2 other parties that happened to be black. While the white people sat in a total different area. Maybe I'm Over reacting. But hell did I ask for a seat in the rear of the restaurant??!!!!!  And who said I wanted to sit next to other black people??!! Don't assume. Black people are treated less than equal wherever we go a lot of the time. Try Hugo Frog bar on the Gold Coast or Riva's at Navy pier.

I finally found the candles I've been searching high & low for (candles for wedding centerpieces). I got a total of 16 candles ranging in sizes from 2 up to 3.5". I was a bit disappointed at the register when the manager instructed the sales clerk to not bother wrapping my candles because they were already in plastic. I wasn't expecting them to be wrapped but then the girl proceeded to stack ALL of the 16 candles in one giant bag. Not only did it make the bag heavy as could be; they also were piled on top of each other. One goal I had when picking the candles was to ensure none of them were chipped or dinged since they are going to be a center",3,0,6/18/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

57rEKCs73DLkmbbUhm4XAQ,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,This is a very surreal Albertson's and that says a lot. Not including your usual eclectic mix of Clairemont/Kearny Mesa folks shopping here either. The store used to have a fresh bakery right up front as you enter. On my last visit it had been closed and was being used to store sale items in big boxers blocking out all approaches to the bakery. Not sure if this was a reconstruction (didn't look like it) or a permanent closure but you rarely see a store just shut down the in-house bakery. This location is constantly being rearranged - as if the manager is neurotic about layouts and keeps changing his mind. The lighting inside seems dimmer than your usual Albertson's also. Looks like the store may have been built in the late 80s or early 90s - it has that popular Albertson's glassed entrance,3,2,4/14/2007,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,294,660,0

The seats are so comfortable- made with memory foam. Movie started on time. Great sound system and huge screen. Heat/ AC was also working good. Never was too hot / freezing like so many other theaters. THe parking lot is massive and still hard to find a spot. Not a fan that once the movie is over that you get pushed into a crowded furniture showroom and not sure of how to get out. I would go back sure yeah.,4,2,1/18/2010,pW9LvtC-hZ0PRAOUn7aZ2A,834,1463,0

First the place was hard to find due to the directions on their website and parking near it was a challenge. The service was fairly slow and we became rushed for time to get to our performance. My dinner partner had short ribs with sweet potatoes which she really enjoyed. I had chicken milanese which arrived at room temperature and was kind of on the tough side. Our waitress was pleasant and tried to please. I'd say Trepiani is okay if you're in the neighborhood and have plenty of time but I would not go out of my way to go there.,3,0,12/18/2011,pa5omruJjZEpBr1CzdUZ7g,27,249,0

Loud and rude and they were a disruption to the entire downstairs but the staff kept seating people right around them. After 10 minutes I asked to be moved and they put us upstairs where it was reasonable. If they would have done that out of the gate it would have been nice. I had a steak and a few sides and my wife had some apps and sides for her meal. The sides were great and my steak was done perfectly but their au poivre sauce was not up to snuff. Service was good and helpful but for these prices I would have expected things to be a bit more polished.,3,0,8/7/2011,2eCTQoBJETQSU-Oi9gjyuw,29,221,1

Not the best but not the worst either. Hush puppies are Hush puppies whatever they are. This meal is neither fantastic nor awful. But it is expensive. I really like BW3's buffalitto lunch special and I can get that for 5.99 where as this average meal is 6.99. Glad I had a coupon but that still make it's 5.99.

5co7pPHt405Ni3Z2B8AJNA,pW9LvtC-hZ0PRAOUn7aZ2A,Two and a half stars for this fairly new Japanese steak house. Here is why: Poorly decorated. It looks as though all the pictures on the walls were purchased at Super 88. Tissue Paper tacky. What is with the 2 hand sinks sticking out from the wall in the middle of the dining room? Hand written notes for the wait staff to follow up on the wall in various places as well as instant Polaroid pictures of past guests scattered all over the walls. Ever thought of getting a bullitian board? Now to the food: The wait staff could not recommend a sake to me. Nor did they return to offer refills on any drinks or offer water.

It usually takes a few minutes to get in with a doctor but that is because they are typically busy especially the days they offer their extended evening hours. The vets themselves are always kind and very loving with our dog. They give him the best care we could ask for and make us aware of the important issues with our dogs health.

5emnxQusmg-d3R2pIh1k-g,Ao2VYIw9AMKOTiCUwe_T9A,I'm from Wisconsin.  This place had the high end Supper Club" feel I'm used to a home.   Well stocked bar with decent TV to see the scores but certainly not to be mixed up as a sports bar.  Smaller classy dining area with excellent attention from waiter during the entire meal made this a great location for a date or bussiness meal.   I had scallops and a crab cake.  Scallops and cake were great but was not impressed wit the tomato type sauce on the crab.  Would have liked another flavor.  Everybody else in my group had some type of fish and everyone enjoyed their meal.   Cheesecake to end the meal made it a very nice experience.  Would love to come back if I'm here for work again.",5,0,6/19/2012,Ao2VYIw9AMKOTiCUwe_T9A,0,95,1

I have been taking my cars there for about 6 years and i have never left feeling as if i just took it up the ass. Pete and his staff are extremely knowledgeable and fair.  The front desk guy is less than charming but Pete himself will generally come explain what the problem is and how they fixed it. They don't wash my car or have snacks for me like Mercedes Benz but Pete's always delivers great service and at a fraction of the cost that the dealership charges.,5,2,6/26/2010,q-UbsVvY9BIWOe_J1mozMA,2,13,0

When the steaks come to the table they are on 500 degree plates.  Thats how they serve them which is nice  because your meal stays warm through the whole thing.  The dessert menu is kind of limited but the key lime pie was good.  Prices were comparable to other steak houses in the city.  We would certainly go again.",4,0,11/6/2010,BXM-cc8HXlRjrrzItvwrOA,4,28,1

She seemed a bit flustered. I then decided to make it simple for her - I asked for three shots of espresso - straight up.

My gf went with the Jimmy D's Firehouse Red...which she has had before and liked. I went with a pint of MonkeyShine Weizenbock which was the only one I could manage. My gf tried some of the samplers and agreed their beers aren't good...won't be coming back to this place...not worth it. Definitely a college bar but even in college I would think their beers are,2,2,9/28/2011,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,59,725,1

We were lucky to get a good table in front of 2 tvs and had awesome service from my stepsister who happens to waitress there.  I hadn't been in years so I was eager to try their food again.  I had the Louisiana chicken sandwich complete with fries and ranch to cool off the sandwich.  My husband got his traditional burger and fries and we ate as we enjoyed the Cardinals winning the World Series. The atmosphere was electric and busy but not too busy to where you'd want to up and leave.  They were all in good spirits and celebrating together as we cheered the Cardinals onto victory!!,4,0,11/1/2011,B3s7gBz3NMFOaNvrzWzLIA,11,186,0

The servers did a good job of taking care of us too. I am sure it helped that the place was very empty.   The food here was good. I can't say say it was the best pizza that I ever have had but it was tasty. They were very generous wth the toppings and did not skimp at all.

There were a ton of communal toys and the majority of the dogs played well together. I also liked that most of the owners seemed very attentive and responsible. They also had plenty of water bowls spread around the park so there was no need to bring your own bowl like many dog parks. The big downside to this place is that it is a sandy gravel surface instead of grass.

We've tried other smaller parks which were closer to our home but this one takes the cake. I do love that it ends up in Lake WA for those who have dogs that want to swim (our older pup has no interest but loves the energy of the water area). It's about a mile plus on the loop down to the swim area and back to the parking lot so it is not too long of a haul for those who worry about hills or distance.

It meant I had to buy a new car....AHHHHHH I procrastinated for a long as I could so I ended up at the Rockingham Honda dealership on RT 28 north. Well what I found was a totally laid back sales guy that was so cool and accommodating he put my anxiety at ease. I bought a used Honda Accord EX and Matthew A sales guy  there made it so easy and I got one hell of a price. I have had a car now for over a year and had 0 problems and had to do only the basic maintenance.

I had a off-site meeting at Suncadia and drove the 90 mins from Seattle to the resort. The website is lacking (it did not show that it had wifi; only wired). I found out only later through the in-room hotel amenities book that it was wireless as well. I didn't bother to try as I did not see any information anywhere on open wifi. I did not pay for my room (as it was covered under the conference being held) so I can't speak to the price but I imagine it was not cheap. Check-in wasn't until 4pm but I was able to get early check-in which I appreciated. My room was beautiful and likely a timeshare when not being used as a hotel room.

I wanted fries and was waiting for her to ask me and then I realized they had no fryer. I saw the beef and the buns that were steaming in the same pan. They looked as though they weren't cooked. My sandwich was wrapped and stuffed in a bag and I didn't even get a soda out of the deal because there was obviously some sort of a rush going on. Me and the guy who drove up after I left. No napkins in the bag and the broad that was in a rush was now outside smoking and talking on her phone. The bun was a soggy uncooked mess. The bee,1,5,1/17/2012,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,356,927,0

As soon as you walk into the restaurant you are like....YES!  Music was a fantastically eclectic blend of old school soul which puts you right in the mood.  The restaurant is actually a lot bigger than it looks from the outside which puzzled me since I figured a place so hard to get in to must be in someone's backyard for god's sake.

It's an interesting little post office for a few reasons - it sits on the side of the road all by its lonesome little self; it is the first country post office I can ever recall seeing with a security fence around the front door (see the picture attached to this review); and the little receipt printers they are using must be 15-20 years old.

Me & my honey were really looking forward to going and we had a great time. You pay $10.00 and we got to ride 3 different trains which was a lot of fun.They have a train that takes you to downtown Monticello so you can go shopping or to dine there.A lot of the engines you can actually go into it and see all the controls.They have old Pullman cars and cabooses that you get to go into as well. We were able to go through there engine house and that was neat seeing all the locomotives being worked on by the volunteers. They have lots of old engines and lots of cars. Everyone is really nice there too and will answer all your questions. This is all ran by volunteers and they all really love the train and the railroa,5,1,7/14/2012,29cMd3kgzjNJPEA4-UlLdA,8,102,0

Nice and flakey with the seasoned crust. I had the shrimp etouffee and I couldn't put my fork down. I tried my friends shrimp creole and it was very good also. The place is pretty big. So there were no crowding issues for a saturday night. But we did feet a little rushed as the server kept coming back to get our order. For the most part it was a pleasent experience.

Can't comment about the food since I really only had a few drinks here but I can say the service was good relative to the number of people we had there.  Our waitress stayed in good graces with probably 20-30 of us all at the same time.  That's not easy.,4,2,4/17/2012,vKUlUXLVylwdttu7h1_Y5Q,22,418,1

I especially liked the large bathroom with whirlpool tub and super nice shower head. The room was very quiet although I was at the end of the hall on the top floor which probably helped. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to provide excellent service. I also really enjoyed both the bar and restaurant in the hotel which was a nice bonus. The only thing I didn't care for is that the location is a bit weird. Its right on the edge of what I guess could be considered a bad or at least not nice neighborhood.

The theater setting in Tahoe was incredible.  You can hear the water crashing on the shore and smell the fresh air.  The seats are well place for good viewing of the stage. The actors in this particular show have a bit more growing to do in relation to delivery of good shakespeare prose. I don't remember Two Gentlemen of Verona being a musical but they sang through the transitions and one of the ladies voices was horrible.  This alone almost made me want to leave despite the great atmosphere.

My ex who told me about this couldnt even give me straight answers as to why he mistreated me when I didnt deserve it. I also noticed that my ex's mentality was to justify and validate reasons for things. People who do Landmark Education may need to undergo a serious mental deprogramming because they brainwash you to think that you're completely messed up and that self actualization will fix things.

No sooner than we sat down a basket of miscellaneous bread and bruschetta arrived on our table.  The bread was some dinner rolls and some pieces of what appeared to be chopped bread sticks with marinara sauce on it.  The bruschetta was OK.  It lacked a lot of the flavoring that I am used to in bruschetta...very little basil and garlic in this batch.  But was was a nice to have something to munch on.

You'll have your food and be done eating in less than the time it would take you to get seated at one of those. I greatly prefer the breakfast menu to the lunch offerings. I specifically like the non-bagel sandwiches. The only negative was that they were OUT OF plates. Instead of wrapping our 4 sandwiches in wax paper or foil or putting them into a to-go box or SOMETHING they put 2 sandwiches on each plate. For 4 people. So we hovered over our shared plates and had to use napkins as plates. REALLY? That is the best problem solving you could muster?

The two of us had more than enough and left stuffed and happy. A few mentionables: -We also ordered a side of rice which never came.

I had reserved a full size car.  When we got to the counter they said that they didn't have any cars available and that we could wait an hour or so to see if one came in or they would offer me a discount on a minivan. At this point I was pretty pissed off becuase I had a reservation and should have a car and I wanted the price I was quoted in my reservation. I also didn't have time to wait around and see becuase I had a wedding to get to.  The two men at the counter were very rude and unhelpful.  I was eventually sent up to their sister company EZ-Rent a Car and they only had minivans but honored the price I had in my reservation. ,1,0,5/23/2011,fJVmR4ZVrP1TkBrWAN32gQ,1,11,0

6v_I1WKFxaI3C7_03c3IMA,OiBmu84gTMZhWqDi2PXhCQ,It's a big airport with lots of traffic.  I'm usually passing through on international flights and transferring terminals can be a bit of a hassle. There are a lot of choices for food and shopping to passing time if you have the time.    Immigration and customs can be time consuming if your in a hurry.  Lots of large flights go through Dulles. Another downfall is metro doesn't come directly to Dulles.  You need to catch a bus to the closest metro station. Free WiFi is a plus if you can't get into any of the airline clubs.

This is my Mom's 'home' hospital since she lives in the South end of Tacoma. This recent trip to the ER was a pretty horrific experience and it was a bit upsetting. I understand staff changes on shifts and that not every nurse or doctor will know what is going on with each patient before they do rounds and read charts. The ER itself is great but once you get admitted to a different segment; it becomes really difficult to try to get any information out of them. The parking is also limited.

The education was pretty mediocre because they kept changing the requirements for graduation and even tried to get me to stay an extra year. That I wasnt going to do because I came in under Barat's current catalog when the merger between the schools became final in 2001 prior to the new year starting. Later DePaul shut Barat down and cited they had no money to keep the school open which was a load of BS. They had the money because they invested in buying the former location of Coyne American Institute's old building and pouring in a whopping $50 million dollars to construct a state of the art dormitory since DePaul has been notoriously famous for having not enough accomodations for students wanting dor,2,0,9/6/2009,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,76,185,1

Not to mention the crappy customer service because I complained about the excessive talking the  cashiers were doing. The manager looked at me as if I was bothering her when her job is to make sure the cashiers are doing their job. Cashiers can make errors when they get distracted when they get too chatty with each other. In the case at this Jewel-Osco they seem to hire a lot of hoodrats mainly like one reviewer said inexperienced teenagers. There's also the issue with them opening up additional lanes in a timely fashion when it gets pretty busy especially at the first of the month when the hoodrats get their food stamps.This location used to be good but has gone down hill with t,2,0,4/11/2011,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,76,185,0

7M7Ki2LnICDffI5NDmFuiQ,MvxlpztD8CyKJPV5dKc1nQ,Bad tour I would not recommend this tour company. We were stopped on our way to Kylemore Abbey by a huckster selling apparently stolen articles. He appeared to know the driver which was scary to say the least. Our tour guide only allowed us 45 minutes at the Abbey saying the tour of the abbey wasn't worth the admission and all we needed to do was get our pictures. I wonder why he thought we would take a 3 hour drive just to take a picture. During our tour he was more interested in one of the ladies on the tour than the rest of us.

There are only 3 staff positions inside the post office and 2 of those positions are always empty. The other one is taken up by Joe from some local company's mailroom who likes to chat with the post office staff and holds the line up for 20 minutes while he mails 20 packages to Saipan or something with no paperwork or postage done. Of course the clerk helping with the transaction is easily just as slow. You have to love the post office.

I believe the Church was situated on the high ground of the property. 1) Nice place to take a reflective walk especially if it's drizzling out. 2) Have seen on more then one occasion - paranormal investigators hanging about around dusk - how festive is that?

There is also plenty of additional seating including some cozy booths. McGurk's also has a spectacular patio and an additional bar on the patio. If you've been to the Soulard location then you probably know how nice the patio is there. The O' Fallon location's patio is very similar on a smaller scale.

I know it was loud and crazy but it just made for a long night. My salad came out before my soup (even though I had asked for it first).

When I get the ticket (since I no longer need it and was selling it on Craigslist its a normal adult fare btw) When I ask them theres no problem selling this right?" they said yeah the drivers need ID from everyone to match the ticket" um ?

Recently I met up with a friend on a Friday night for dinner and drinks.  Our waitress Jocelyn was very nice and friendly.  They have great happy hour prices AND their happy hour goes to 7pm! Whenever I go to an Irish place I always get the corned beef.  I was not disappointed with theirs. Lots of cabbage and potatoes to accompany the corned beef.  They slice the corned beef into strips.  Oh man.  It's making my mouth water just thinking of it!

Their omelets are oven baked and everything is really good here at least for breakfast as i have never been here for lunch yet.  The service is fast and friendly but I always feel like I am being rushed as they need to turn my table as soon as I get up from my chair.  This place is always packed on the weekends so if you go thee during the week it will be your best bet to not have to wait.  If you do go on the weekend try to get there early as it seems that their peak hours are 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM,4,8,3/14/2006,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

We found (free) parking at the Wallingford Center (where Trophy is located) and so that was an extra bonus. The store itself is setup so adorably! From the party favors to the decorations and the coffee stand and cupcakes themselves. The flavors change daily and have a few that are 'fixed' constantly. They do also provide flavors of the 'month' which happened to be mint cookies & cream and vanilla cookies & cream. The prices are on the high side (ranging from $3.50 to $4.50 based on flavor) but can be a good treat now and then. Definitely,4,1,1/3/2012,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

7Z_m44exSglrpWjVRyMMlg,-e5VFAI-WBHBL7PFMNArDg,This is a small regional airport that is pretty easy to navigate. There isn't much to report on the dining and shopping - simple and compact. It is really close to downtown San Diego and has amazing views of the city. The airport is undergoing construction plus the arrivals and departures pick up in the same area. The traffic to pick up for arrivals or drop off for departures is not segregated. The traffic seems to stack up a bit entering the airport. Grabbing a taxi to downtown is $12-15. The rental car locations are nearby and the transportation is easy and convenient.,3,1,8/19/2012,-e5VFAI-WBHBL7PFMNArDg,46,307,1

80j0RarkYWCreH9-8Pj9HQ,kMsX9ZxCfwgjZDEdCDej9Q,One of the unique eating establishments that make you want to try it. The place did seem hamburger centric" with many options to try. I went with the mushroom burger which claimed to source local mushroom. The grilled "shrooms" were tasty. The beef patty itself was not the biggest...but it was delicious. Our waitress did mess up the orders (or was it the kitchen staff?). One of the orders had the incorrect condiments. One of the orders was for onion rings but french fries were served instead. The staff graciously replaced the fries but it was 15 minutes later. Bob makes a decent burger....but not as good as a Five Guys or a Fat Burger.",3,0,11/17/2011,kMsX9ZxCfwgjZDEdCDej9Q,54,416,0
80rTMSEdWy-jQNKWUZ9Sng,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,The Zephyr Deli is located just off the lobby inside the Grand Hyatt - right next to Starbucks. Good place for a quick breakfast or lunch. Stopped in here one morning for breakfast. Went for their Ham and Swiss quiche. It's a pre-made round little pie - they throw it in the microwave to heat it up - which I don't have a problem with. I think Quiche lends itself particularly well to being heated in a microwave. The quiche was very tasty and savory. The top of the quiche had a number of ham chunks right at the surface of the quiche and these were nicely charred and caramelized. I'd recommend coming here and will be back again to try some of their breakfast sandwiches as well as their bacon.,4,1,12/3/2009,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0

81zKOOy2zVxixNziH53TFw,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,So this place get's crazy busy and the wait for a table is pretty long. However they have a great setup so it doesn't seem nearly as bad as you would expect it to be. The trick is that they open a tab when you check in so you can get a drink and then mill around while waiting. The inside waiting area is a bit small so we headed outside. They have a large lawn and two areas with fire pits. One of them has chairs around it while the second one has stones setup to sit on. It was actually a nice way to wait for a table. That said the wait was still unbelievably long. The beer selection is VT focused as it should be. I like that they carry McNeils instead of say Magic Hat since its a little less common.

She also suggested the muscles with anchovy (which I don't like) and the couple went with that. I had the muscles with old bay and Guinness. We all liked our meals.

Their is a dining room and the bar- but I have only really been in the bar.  They have a decent draft beer selection - although the last time I went the Killian's tasted a little on the funny side.  The bar food is as greasy as I like it.  Prices are reasonable and service is friendly. I think they have live music and karaoke on varying nights - They also have some rooms above the restaurant/bar area if you need a place to crash. :) If you find yourself in St. Clair and looking for a beverage - this would be my suggested stop to you. :),4,3,3/3/2010,nt143HoSFyPLsVNaI1fGrQ,49,266,0

8AovCZeoWrhGjlYdsPngFg,Y4Du3cllZ_gpNjzTvmeZ0Q,YUMMY!!!!!!!!! This location was the restaurant that introduced me to the food genre that is Thai. The store has changed a bit since I moved to KC (the main lobby was closed for remodeling for a good bit of time) however it came back stronger than ever. Absolutely beautiful decorations. Even better is the poor man's indoor courtyard that is attached to the right of the building. absolutely soothing and relaxing when you need to get away from the office @ lunch. Now to the food.This place is wowwoweee amazing! The pad Thai noodles are always perfectly done and to the right spice and consistency. I have also had the panang curry and that is also one of those must have items. I had the Pad sea ew once and I am not a fan of it at all. very different taste. I wouldn't recommend it unless you ar,5,0,10/23/2008,Y4Du3cllZ_gpNjzTvmeZ0Q,206,562,0

The course's pro and staff were offering a demonstration on several short game techniques plus fun practice exercises. The Pro was pleasant and brief with the demonstration. He made sure we got all the info and still made himself available for questions. A group of 17 of us were able to watch and then practice our skills in a series of fun challenges to test our skills. It was a fun 2 hours on the area where the Juniors get to practice - a $500k playing ground. The roads leading to the course and club house were not well marked and a little confusing. You can see that some of the buildings in the park were once glorious structures. This is a busy park with cars playing loud music and people flowing in and out.

They have some good dishes and the back patio can be a nice place to eat and have a few cocktails. ( Fun on Friday nights watching the football games in the back yard) The Tiger Cry is one of the better appetizers in the city and is well worth the try. The soups have never impressed me and I would skip them. The one problem I have noticed is the chicken in dishes can be very chewy.

8BAnFhYrlfQUIwRk5uUozA,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,There is something to say about reading the reviews before you actually visit the restaurant. I didn't choose this joint so it's not my fault. Sunday night we had about 14 people on the patio. Great night for some brews under the stars. But the waitress must have had a parttime job down the street because every time we asked her for something she would run away. Then show up 20 minutes later. Oh! And the place was empty. The pie kinda sucked. This is suppose to be an Irish pub. For adults. Then why is there so much sugar in the pizza? Did they lower the drinking age to 12? The fun I had was with the people that I came with. Next time I will veto this joint and suggest a place with a little more personality and service.,2,1,7/27/2009,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,356,927,0

I got to Wrigleyville early and was headed to Red Ivy to meet up with some friends when a girl at the door of The Curse asked me if I would like a free drink... I had time to spare so I figured why not. My boyfriend and I got free drink tickets and one of the bartenders said if I brought the birthday party here they would throw in a fish bowl... so I did. They gave us a fishbowl consisting mostly of hypnotic and lemonade Vitamin Water. Then when my group of friends arrived they gave us all drink tickets. So obviously we tipped well. I am definitely a fan! Who an complain with free drinks?! The set up of the bar is also really cool. they have a glass garage door in the front that was open when I arrived but as it started to get chilly they closed.

Inside was beautifully furnished and all the furniture was original as the estate has stayed within the Clay family. The docent was funny and confident and insightful. The only fault I found with the whole tour was the lack of discussion about slavery. There had been slaves on the property and an excavation of the grounds where the slave cabin was located. Ashland had a hemp farm and a there is a picture of Clay in his death bed with his trusted slave.... All the tour guide really mentioned was Clay supporting black people going to Africa to settle in Liberia. Also I know it was 95 degrees out but we never discussed the history of the buildings on the grounds of the estate....

We also tried the Littleneck clams and they were served hot and were good. I wish they would have given us some horseradish though. Our server only had 4 tables but seemed extremely busy. She did check on us but feel as if our drinks were always empty.

I told her we would be downstairs and she said she would find us. 45 minutes later we realized the hostess never came to get use. The bartender went to inquire about our table and the hostess said she could not find us... I was not upset because that gave us the chance to enjoy some margaritas. I had the last two margaritas on the menu. The Fresco was my favorite but both were excellent. They were served on the rocks. I also had the seasonal sangria which was white wine with apple infused vodka and grilled apples... it was fantastic.

I ordered the #182 which was the beef and broccoli. I got huge portion of food for cheap ($8.95).  It was very tasty! I was also able to sample the #47 which was a soup that I forgot the name. That was really good too.  I thought the ginger flavor in the broth was very unique. The service was good and the ambiance was nothing to write home about.  Actually my only complaint was that the chairs were not all that comfy.,4,4,5/3/2007,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,1

Overall I think it wasn't bad but it was a little on the uppity side if you know what I mean.

8GZF2gLie057GusR01JLPQ,KM_ue1c95XeKgrd-MeGS0A,A cute little ice cream and burger joint with a throwback to the 50s feel to it. Stopped in with my Mom on a Saturday after a lovely ride through the NC countryside. She and my dad come in every once in awhile and she'd been telling me how wonderful it was so happy to give it a try. They serve both soft serve and hard ice cream. Sundaes and things are made default with soft serve but they'll make you something with the regular hard ice cream if you want which is what we opted for. Mom enjoyed a banana split that looked simply wonderful and I had a scoops of vanilla and black cherry with butterscotch sauce and nuts. Mmmmm yummy. Also tried their onion rings - made with diced onions (so probably I suspect frozen) they were nothing outstanding but were a nice salty accompaniment to our aftern,4,0,7/18/2010,KM_ue1c95XeKgrd-MeGS0A,86,413,0

Every flavor I've ever had was great and the sundaes are well made. The sizes are huge and the prices are reasonable. They also have one of the best real home made waffle cones around. I only have 2 issues with them which are that they plug the bottom with a marshmallow and if its hot you will always get an ice cream dribble coming out the bottom at some point and that they run out of them when its really busy. So make sure to wrap the bottom of the cone with a napkin. There is plenty of room to park and all the seating is at picnic tables which under big shady trees so even when its super hot you can sit outside without getting baked.,5,2,6/18/2009,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,58,629,0

I have been jonesing for a greasy burger for a couple of weeks now. I didn't get that here. What I did get was a burger with my choice of cheese with fresh veggies in it and a bun that tasted like they made it today. The fries were crinkle cut and crispy.

All the dishes were excellent and reasonably priced. The food and 3 beers came to $60 with tip for 3 of us. They only serve beer and Mike's Margarita in a bottle (yuch!).

I walked in and it was already semi-busy (I believe they open at 8am). The service wasn't too bad or slow as some have said. It took probably 30mins or so for our food to arrive. Everything was made from scratch & I was really surprised at the fruit bowl. Most places offer you 'fruit' which has been either in a pre-made fruit cocktail mix or old fruit. I wasn't able to finish most of the fruit since it was so large. I ordered the eggs with bacon and substituted the fruit for another $1.79.

Be sure to get the basket of half onion rings and half fries - both excellent - as an ala carte extra with your meal. One basket is sufficient for a group of 3-4 from our experience. We enjoyed the Hula Burger (BBQ sauce & fresh pineapple) as well as some of their other selections. Portions are HUGE. Both times my wife and I split a burger and it was ample. My son ordered chicken fingers and got like 6 large fillets - could have served 2-3 people. Try to sit out on the patio for that out door feel.

8mfzHsb-zVwDyGQOX3cmYg,AX6TWJtUn0UXKROrR7ZdAw,This Pick'n Save  is one of their older model stores both in store layout and merchandise selection.  Store is in need of a remodel and updating and is a bit dingy and in some places unkempt.  Store is smaller so it has fewer SKU's than most Pick'n Saves.  Produce area is decent but they have it layed out so you have to walk down a long aisle to get to something 5 feet away.  If you are looking for a better store drive a few miles down the road to Sendik's or V Richards,2,4,3/27/2012,AX6TWJtUn0UXKROrR7ZdAw,133,287,0

We originally were going to do EddieMartinies but upon looking at my foursquare I discovered this place- and it had great reviews. We headed over. Parking was pretty easy. It was around 5PM on a Friday night. There is street parking but there is also a public lot across the street if you're having some problems. Upon arriving I immediately loved it. It's a small window front with some outdoor seating and the inside is adorable. Since we were catching up our waiter was very patient with our chit chatting and not really ordering.

It was also cool to see that they have a lot of vegetarian and gluten free options available as well as all the great BBQ. Started off with the BBQ beef brisket nachos which come out on a tray that is the size of a cookie sheet. So clearly the portion is very large. While a large portion they didn't just load it with chips and few toppings. There was plenty of cheese and brisket and sauce on almost every single chip on the tray. The brisket was perfectly cooked and the sauce is very tasty with a little hint of spiciness. For beer I went with a double bock which was a nice mix of malty and hoppiness.

8TKxRLb-HPWQvRI-x5S-Cw,mhp7ixQA9dqRqXKYcW3F7Q,I've always loved the Ordway. It's been a family tradition of mine since I was growing up.This place will always hold a place in my memory bank of fond memories. I saw the Sound of Music starrring Jack from Days of Our Lives (if anyone watched that) and Little House on the Prairie which I gave up for Lent one year when I was younger. (The tv show that is). Both times the seats were spectacular for not being on the main floor. I love this place around Christmas time. Beautiful place to see a play. Kind and helpful ushers. Wonderful productions. Often times there are ticket specials for various plays pre- season. Wonderful way to spend an afternoon or evening especially in the winter time.,5,0,9/7/2010,mhp7ixQA9dqRqXKYcW3F7Q,167,757,0

I was hoping for bigger and better things than my visit two yrs ago. Nope. It looks much better and intriguing from the outside than what actually takes place inside. Not scary and unfortunately all the tourists that come here for Halloween inevitably end up at this haunted house b/c of the location.

I happened to try it on a windy evening when I was in the neighbourhood. Me and my friend were greeted at the door by the hostess. The decor is really nice.They have a full bar. Menu is pretty exhaustive and covers most of the usual fare linked to Ind-Chinese cuisine. I went ahead and ordered my all time regulars Shrimp Manchurian and hakka noddles. Our food arrived really quick. I am no stranger to Indo-Chinese cuisine but please don't sell greasy food with overdose of spices as Indian Chinese. The food did not entice my taste buds at all. I would say the hakka noodles were atleast mediorce as compared to Shrimps.

Granted the seats are smaller and the rooms are smaller than the larger mega theaters but there's something about a more intimate space that makes watching the movie a more personal experience.  It's fun to hear other people's laughter and reactions to the film--almost like being in your own living room!  I haven't tried the foods offered in the dining space but I think it would be a nice option before the movie.  I also noticed that one can rent movies there.  I will definitely have to go here more often.,4,0,6/25/2011,-GDdBOfhrxn7lAGblLSoqA,4,71,0

The absolutely only redeeming factor to this restaurant was the service.

The service was okay.  The server who was out on the sidewalk was much friendly than the one who actually served us.

Don't think for a minute that you'll be having conversations with your friends - without yelling in their ear. The main floor has a stage for a band - the band on hand on Saturday night was playing covers of dance songs and some danceable rock n' roll. The bar on the main floor is on the right hand side and runs almost the length of the joint. There is also a second dance area downstairs which had a DJ spinning more traditional hot dance songs. Then there is the rooftop bar area - very crowded - but kind of cool - and a little easier to hear - but not much. It was a fairly humid evening out - and when one walked downstairs to the basement - you could feel that the AC was working pretty well - but when you entered the Men's,3,1,10/7/2007,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,1

The Vegetarian Food festival was held for two days.I got to know about this event when it was posted on Yelp. There were two type of tickets to the event - One with VIP entry for $20 bucks which skips line and allows mutiple entry/exit to festival and other with $5 where one has to wait in line. Me and friend had to wait for 35 minutes and we arrived liitle past 11. The line by then was more than a block but the good thing  it kept on moving fast.

But I do take a moment to appreciate this wonderful building and the inviting plaza out front (home to the farmers market on Saturday morning). Its a warm space with all the trappings of colonial architecture with almost a humble atmosphere. Reminds me a lot of the town hall in the small town where I grew up. There's a nice garage underneath the plaza where you can get really cheap parking in the evenings and on weekends.

I start to walk past them thinking they are smoking or hanging out or whatever only to find out the bar is at capacity. There is seriously a line to get inside a bar in Burlington. WTF! I wait because I wanted to check the place out and it turns out to only take like 5 or 10 minutes. So finally I get in and the place is completely jammed with people and its almost impossible to move. They are playing super loud hipster type music and the crowd was a mix of granola hippy people and trendy hipsters.

9f7qFCS2xeX1koATMor6JQ,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,Ever since the remodel of the casino about a year ago the buffet has taken a turn for the better. This is probably the #1 buffet of the casino circuit. It is also one of the most expensive at $15.99 (with club discount) at lunch. The regular lunch price alone is $18.99. Dinner will probably be significantly worse. The food has always tasted fresh here to me and there is more of an assortment here than at other buffets. Servers were prompt in refreshing drinks. I normally only go during lunch as dinner waits can be absurd. Ambiance - 4; Food - 4; Service - 4 = 12 / 4 = 4 A solid 4 * performer.

The pineapple cake with cream cheese icing was incredible and I do not even like pineapple cake.  It tasted like it had real good quality pineapple in it and the frosting was very smooth. The triple chocolate cake was my favorite.  The filling between the layers was cool and creamy.  I will wear grooves in the sidewalk between my work and this bakery going after this cake.   We also bought a pieces of buttermilk pie but have not tried it yet.   There were about 10 different desserts to choose from in the case and they were all conveniently packaged for easy carryout.,4,0,5/12/2010,1iJ4HoDOGSeIdyZQG6Qzww,83,192,0

All of the chair positions along the bar running along the front of the coffee shop have their own AC outlet. I staked out a position here to work. The place is very relaxed and chill.

I would certainly consider this hotel for a stay cation being in the Tampa Bay area and would recommend highly for business. The one drawback is that the parking garage is a couple blocks away making it inconvenient if you're in and out a lot. The alternative is",4,1,4/15/2012,pbyxWMCyRe8_NZihJToYKw,33,185,0

Love that they open the large windows in the summer and you feel like your outside. Fritz also sponsors many local gay league sports teams. Also to be noted...the well drinks are super strong and very reasonably priced. Finally they also serve brunch on Sat and Sundays. One eve they also serve free pizza but not sure which one.

The one thing they could do better is provide more electrical outlets to plug into - they are at a premium - folks are jockeying for position to find a place to plug in.

When we checked in (at 5:15 p.m.) we were informed that the previous night's guests had checked out late so the room was not clean.

I was informed that the previous night's guests actually hadn't checked out until 45 MINUTES AFTER we had arrived at 6 p.m. (check in is listed at 3 p.m.).

The interior is large and new looking.  It is tastefully decorated with lots of wood.  There are a fair number of TVs but they are not overly obtrusive.  I sat at the bar in the center of the place.  It is a large rectangular bar with seating all around.  There is a big fish tank in the center.  The bar stools were comfortable and there was a chair rail for my feet.  They also had purse hooks for the ladies.

9_ZNWVdpIvURCJxno8lkQQ,gWrfDg97-1GtQVVUhuUKBQ,We frequent this place every month just to rotate between this place and JinMi. This place also serves sushi but we've always come here for Korean food. The place gets packed and service sometimes falls short but the food is consistently amazing. They serve Jap Chae and have a bigger menu than most Korean places I've ever been. It is BYOB and they're not stingy on their side dishes. The place is pretty hidden and easy to miss but has huge Intel. The food is very authentic and the business has huge following.

9_ZTucFAR-o6CqKLYPseIw,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,Is it possible to review a lake? It's difficult but I will say a few things about this one in particular. 1. It's unique (I guess from a NJ resident perspective) to look at a lake and then turn around and see sky scrapers...such a cool feeling. 2. The color of the water is unique. It's teal like. Hard to explain so you need to check it out for yourself. 3. They have a beach...yeah on the lake...unique. 4. It's clean. 5. A nice cool breeze comes off of it but I am sure during the winter people curse it! A must (actually hard to miss) see....ENJOY!,4,0,9/19/2012,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,59,725,0

A-wSyvzAjYp3BnjyN_WhFA,ZhBppt_sn8CNJ76PbZeMyw,My big turnoff for this place: doesn't accept credit cards. This is bad because I never carry cash anymore and would have been nice to know before I went inside. I just didn't get into the whole Woodman's experience. It had a weird vibe to the place. Their prices were not much lower than a Walmart and the selection was kinda limited. It just didn't blow me away. It probably didn't help that the employees retrieving the carts were goofing off and almost drove about 12 shopping carts in my car. I'll pass.,2,1,5/10/2010,ZhBppt_sn8CNJ76PbZeMyw,74,346,1

We called for a reservation on Saturday night with short notice and they were able to seat our party of 4.  All the waiters were pleasant and were joking around with us.  The place is small but cozy. The bread they give you?  AMAZING.  It's nice and salty and served with a tomato flan that was to die for.  It had a nice spicy kick that was unexpected.  We started out with two mista verde salads - which was plenty for the four of us.  We also ordered an antipasto that was just okay.  I've had better.   Then came the main course.  Wowza.  I got the rigatoni special that had sweet sausage and arugula on top.  Pasta is definitely made in house and it is GREAT.  I didn't want to share my m,5,0,5/4/2012,QwAjjsRtRN3EgZohN3Yz3g,2,55,0

There is a well equipped and spacious 24 hour gym with a view of the street from the cardio equipment. Minus.  Pay wi-fi.  In 2012 charging for wi-fi is like charging for the TV.  And I won't pay for Internet because hotel Internet is always the worst.  I went to Starbucks across the street instead.,3,1,6/27/2012,WKpzoB_oom4OSEe703-uxw,29,142,0

Mine said double and it was a single. My wife's said single and it was a double... She did not realize it until she had picked all of the stuff off that she asked them to leave off... So I gave her mine unopened original burger then I had to put all of my condements back on... Don't even get me started on the A&W Rootbeer. Terrible. Does no one quality control the fountain?

a1Kt1-0elBWpnGwNzLddhQ,dD1_XwgaHM0oxlx2XeYgZw,Not awful but not great either. The injera is nice and sour but isn't as fresh as it could be. The lima beans are definitely the most impressive of the veggie dishes. We scarfed them down first. The spicy lentils are more hot-spice than layered-spice and the collard greens were fairly flavorless. The yellow peas were bland but the texture was good. The Saturday-night act was pretty painful to listen to and ruined what otherwise would be a fairly cozy atmosphere. Service was prompt and friendly.,3,0,4/10/2011,dD1_XwgaHM0oxlx2XeYgZw,17,204,0

I was here once when that 10 year old boy was working.  Somehow the topic of my vegetarianism came up with him.  I think he was trying really hard to understand vegetarianism but it came off as extremely argumentative.  I was really hungover and just wanted my freakin' food.  Urgh.,2,1,10/30/2008,hNBPq9LkONSSyJkOpWSjYQ,44,231,0

I ordered the ostrich sandpot (#9) and was told it would take 15 minutes.  They had it ready exactly 15 minutes later and it was presented on a plastic foodcourt tray that was lined with thick cardboard to avoid the pot melting the tray.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_p… Opening the claypot revealed a very generous amount of toppings.  The ostrich meat was cooked perfectly - nice and tender while being very well seasoned with a little bit of heat which was a nice surprise!  The mushrooms were also plentiful and had the perfect consistency while retaining a strong shiitake flavour.  The greens were also tender and steamed ,5,16,3/5/2012,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,0

The interior is too starkly plain and quiet for me.  Like someone's dull interpretation of Ikea.  I'll trade the plain austerity of the bakery for the fresh air across the street in Golden Square.   The roll was still warm at 10:30am.   It was a good morning =),4,5,11/7/2011,dsu43n2DOR_pB07P1sOOZg,50,322,0

I tried the Southwest Chicken wrap. They were missing a couple of the veggies it listed and the majority of the wrap was lettuce. There was some pretty big chuncks of grilled chicken but everything else was lacking and the "salsa" they put on it made it soggy. My dinner date at the buffalo chcken wrap.

I was just in for lunch so just grabbed some beef chow fun.  It is really a test dish for me at Cantonese restaurants as the wok skill (or lack thereof) is difficult to hide. It was really just ok.  The beef was tender and flavourful.  The noodles were clumpy as they had not been properly separated before stir-frying.  For many of the clumps there were as many as 4 or 5 flat noodles stuck together.  This resulted in the sauce not getting into the noodles like it should and there being a white less cooked part inside of each clump.  No,3,13,Update - 12/19/2011,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,0

You can completely enjoy some outdoor fun for the whole family with a fraction of the crowd that you will find at the Oak Street or North Avenue Beach areas. It is a little off of the beaten path but the lack of massive crowds is well worth it! If you don't feel like a beach head on over to the park and find a shady spot on a bench and relax or take the kids to the playground!

A7y6NXXGHc_C2KZ9yToQVw,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,This 76 gas station is right on the corner of 85th and Aurora and faces a Arco station. I like to think this forces it to be a little more competitive since Arco will try to lowball all the gas prices. I drove past it on the way to work and saw it at $0.15 more a gallon for Unleaded vs. the Arco and was tempted to fill up at Arco. On the way home from work (about 8 hours later); I decided to risk it and stop at the 76. It had dropped $0.10/gal off. So I guess my quick tip would be to wait til later in the day to pump because they change prices after 8am if they are going to change. The pumps are a little older but did the job.,3,0,11/22/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

It's $20/day for self parking and $30/day for valet. Check In was at 3pm but like everyone else we didn't come to check in until after 3:30pm when the Jay's game ended so it got delayed a bit however that was understandable. We stayed in a City View King Room which was located on the Third Floor with views that looked out onto the front/entrance of the hotel.

Yeah! Right! Lie to me baby lie to me! munch munch munch.   After the first little piece I chomped on I felt this vision of enjoying more with a carton of milk with a straw in it as in elementary school days.  Instead I opted to pour myself a mug of milk and dip some chunks in and enjoy.  And milk with a chunk that has sunk to the bottom and somewhat sludged up is just too blissful for words.,4,1,8/29/2011,dk5yqirSwDH7Cpp52NdhUA,35,302,0

Was shopping for car starters with my bf and getting help was extremely difficult.  I asked 4 associates for help and all of them looked clueless and said they don't work this department.  All four said let me get someone that is working in here.  waited 40 minutes until I got any assistance.  Never will go here again. But moving forward my bf purchased me the car starter for Christmas.  I made my appt and got the car in first thing and was told it was going to take 3-6 hours.  Ended up being 9 hours and I was super late picking up the kids from daycare which cost me a lot of extra money.  I called to check on the status and the guy which I know who it was but I wont name any names gave a huge attitude over the phone and was being super rude and not understanding.

I had asked for extra sour cream.. they had the nerve to charge me 25 cents for extra sour cream.. which I ended up tossing out anyway! The fish tacos sounded great.. only when I opened the box..

I can only stomach this place for a drink at the most before I feel the urge to run away and never come back. The only reason why I come here is that sometimes my friends want to come here after the other bars close.  Most of the time I decline but everyone and then when I am the driver I will suck it up and take one for the team.   The service is adequate at best.  The place just reeks of old beer.  Th place is always in a state of disarray and 99% of the crowd should be in bed passed out before they even came there.  Instead they are at the Valley getting on my last nerve.,1,7,12/24/2006,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

Personally to me the place was very spread out. They do play very loud music but I didn't see anybody dancing so might become difficult to strike a conversation over food because of loud food. The drinks very overpriced. The only best thing about this place is big space with spread out different sections.,3,3,5/21/2012,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,29,559,0

Outside is another seasonal bar area with sand volleyball pit. Inside the bartender was friendly and there didn't seem to be any attitude from the staff or patrons inside.

Snake River Saloon has been very impressive. It is a fairly small place and you would never guess that they have a wonderful menu. My husband took me on a date here and it was a wonderful place. The decor was outdated but who cares. We weren't there for the chairs or walls. We were there for the food. We got the escargot and the Filet Oscar. We did not have enough room for dessert but the Escargot and Filet Oscar was fantastic. the charm of this place is not the fact that it looks like a fine dinning restaurant with all the jazz but the unexpected stuff that comes out of the kitchen.

There was a pretty good crowd and the accoustics were good which I appreciated. I'm not a fan of places that are too small to host a live band and the shrill ends up driving people away because it's too noisy. Our server reminded me of Karen from Will and Grace.

Most of the Subways I've visted were owned and run by Arab and Indians and many didnt hold high standards for cleanliness. I also liked this place because they make your order right and that's what this owner takes seriously is customer satisfaction. Not to mention he does not hire thugs and hoodrats to work in his establishment he hires people who want to work and have an honest job not someone who walked off the street who's mouth is dirtier than a public restroom toilet.

AokI5vFdo0uwSyWuc9vGxw,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,By far the best pizza joint in Toledo. The pizza has a thin crust and a great sauce. The sandwiches are also very good and filling. The Italian is my favorite. Home Slice also has great cheesy bread. The restaurant itself is small but nice and cozy. I like the upstairs bar area with sitting the best but I have ate downstairs before. They offer pretty good drink specials and usually have some sort of offers during the weekdays. One of the best times to visit Home Slice is when the Mud Hens are in town because it is conveniently located across the street from Fifth Third Field. This was my favorite restaurant during the four years I spent in Toledo. Whenever I am in town I have to stop and grab some pizza here.,5,0,9/17/2011,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,10,92,0

I am glad that she offered a trial run before the wedding day. On the day of she commuted to the place where it was held and did our makeup there. I was still nervous how out makeup would come out.

I did not think it would be so difficult in such a multicultural place. This place is located in a touristy plaza of Sunny Isles which explains their high end" prices for mediocre food.  It's like they are trying too hard. They even took off their shrimp dishes because the restaurant became all kosher. First thing I noticed...the expensive margarita tasted like pure mix. Where's the tequila??? I had to get a double for it to taste normal. I felt cheated on that. Of course a Mexican restaurant it's only as good as its guacamole...& I cant even remember what theirs tasted like.

The store is pretty big inside and has a variety of cheeses that they make on site and they have samples available of all of them. So no need to wonder if you will like it or not or if paying extra for the 2 year aged over the 1 year aged is worth it or not. They also stock a wide range of cheeses from other local Vermont companies and farms. I picked up some fresh goat cheese as well that was awesome. In addition to cheese they had Vermont wines (which I never realized existed) and selections from every brewery in Vermont I have ever heard of.

at_RzMiWgJabrwyxZl7-lw,bmtNNp1vzcLZ-TyVudQFIw,I love LALA its a great gym with tons of sexy going on. truely this is the only gym I have ever been a memeber to but I feel like its a hell of lot cleaner and friendlier then most gyms. There are some really great classes offered including spinning (my fav) everyday of the week.I do wish they had a couple more classes offered but maybe that will be in the near future.The locker rooms is always super clean and doesnt gross me out. The lockers are a bitch though. 6 outa 10 dont work. One day it took me moving all my stuff 4 times to actually find one that worked. Besides the locker issue I really like the gym. Its never over crowded and I notice that almost everyone practices good hygiene alot of people wipe down there equipement which I greatly appreciate.I dont want to contract some flesh,4,3,12/9/2010,bmtNNp1vzcLZ-TyVudQFIw,22,229,0

That is probably the best part of Ichabod's - the food itself was rather unremarkable. I had nachos - and a cold beer - and the beer was the best part of dinner.

We visited Blakeney House during the off season and received a very reasonable nightly rate.  The daily breakfast was delicious.  The B&B is a short (5-10 mins) walk from a gorgeous coastal walk and within easy walking distance of all the local restaurants and pubs.  Blakeney House is a short drive from the popular ferries that provide tours to see the seals.   Blakeney House is an absolutely adorable B&B in a great little town.  Book quickly--although considering,5,1,5/1/2012,79LjNkAODyzlwW2X4AqkfA,13,65,0

The beef was the best but within the last year or so the restaurant has changed management and so went it's quality. It's so sad because Michaels use to be packed all day and now you'll be lucky to see a single sole come in and order food. The quantity is much less when ordering the italian beef special and the food just does not taste the same.

The food is decent but nothing special. But - the main reason that I will not return is how they treated my 79 year old mother with arthritis. Although we had 15 of our group of 16 ready to be seated - and the table was ready - they refused to let us sit down. Even after I told them of my mom's poor health they refused to seat us.

This place is fairly new - only been open about 3 weeks according to the girl working the front counter. I asked if they had Pho - she advised that the only Pho they offer is Pho Ga - which was perfect - exactly what I needed! When the Pho came out - the color of the broth looked promising - not to clear and not to dark. The thing that surprised me though - were the noodles. They were much thicker/wider than the very thin noodles I'm used to. The young lady working the counter came over to check on me - I asked about the noodles.

Axcp5Ht3UojSv3woWqV2WQ,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,Nice little local florist located right in Haymarket. I ordered some flowers for Valentine's Day - I called in the order a couple of days ahead of time - to be ready for the Saturday before Valentine's Day. Picked up the flowers in the early afternoon. The arrangement was all ready and the flowers were in gorgeous condition. I even got the ladies there to find me a box to keep the vase somewhat stabilized during transport in the car. And I met the Melanie" of Melanie's Florist. Very nice lady! They were very busy and I thought a little tired (I'm guessing they had been putting in a lot of long hours for the holiday) and still had a smile on their faces!

In fact all the staff was very courteous and professional. The location can't be beat - the hotel is right in the middle of everything. It's very close to Millennium Park and the Wendella Boat Rides are right next to it. The shops at North Bridge are only 5 blocks away. You can easily walk to Navy Pier as well.

My buddy and I hit up Nami on a Monday afternoon (we were the only 2 people in the restaurant) and placed an order for some soup and sushi. There were 2 waitresses and the sushi chef in the main dining area. It took us about 20 mins to get some water and another 10 -20 mins at least for the soup and the sushi chef just came up to our table and gave us the sushi since the 2 girls who were supposed to be waiting on customers just decided to have some girl time (z-snap). The food is just average and something you can find at almost any sushi bar and I feel it's a little pricey compared to other establishments with much better food.

I was still not convinced but the associate knew a lot of details about me so I thought this company seems legitimate.

All money is due upfront 30 days prior to check in. I made an exception with you. I don't have time to chase rent around especially on vacation rentals.

Not so at Senior Tequila. We had no fewer than 5 servers arrive at our table with increasingly awful attitude. The final straw was a team of two who arrived to show us the 48 ounce glass for the Margarita we ordered. SHOW US THE GLASS? As if we were too stupid to know that was a lot of Margarita?

Both were excellent following the wonderful Salmon small plate. We finished off the evening with the Grand Marnier Souffle.

bByGtbAX6LmHNIJOOnM0ZQ,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,I know it's just a bridge but I can justify my five stars here. It's an absolute miracle of the human effort. I always admire the amount of foresight the architects had when they were building these architectural marvels. Unlike Brooklyn Bridge(BB) this bridge offers much more to the pedestrians. Separate lane for pedestrians and bikers is a big relief for pedestrians. At BB it was a constant struggle for bikers and people jogging juggling for space. The bridge gives awesome view of the city skylines which is definitely worth watching. Hopefully coming summers I will be a regular at WB with my bike or just jogging.,5,6,2/18/2012,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,29,559,0
BBYptYypYa9ZLXTFF9tVOQ,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,The last visit to Pier 39 was over 15 years ago. I should know by now that nostalgia does wonders on memories. I enjoyed strolling around the Pier on a beautiful sunny winter day and being able to look at all the trinket shops and eat a semi-decent meal. It didn't seem to have the appeal or bustle though that I remember it from years ago. So many places trying to get you to come in and eat and pitching their chowder" was the best. We ended up browsing for a few hours in all the shops and getting a souvenir or two for our nephews but wasn't as fun as I remember it.",3,0,12/10/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,1

bCbDLktlnIg4RQDyBYyRag,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,Very nice place inside. Friendly staff and wasn't terribly busy for a Sunday lunch. My gf had the chicken sandwich and I had the burger. Very salty on both parts and loaded with melted butter on the bread. Over toasted buns as well. Burger was good but about the size of a mini burger anywhere else. The fries were just ok (over cooked). Staff was friendly although we were the only ones at the bar and we were being helped by 3 different people. Not in a rush to go back anytime soon. We were both disappointed in our overall meals but not with the service. Good beers on tap is the saving grace.,3,0,2/1/2010,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,59,725,0
BcIHI-8masKJCCsax1cFvg,MI3wG3R12sQuTGdNvBBX3A,I've been in the parade (representing Oak Park) and have watched it from the sidelines. It is CAH-RAY-ZEE and I love it. People really get into this parade. I myself have thought about my outfit days and weeks in advance. It's an event and it's wonderful. Everyone is happy and friendly and accepting. I've often told people that it's my favorite holiday. Getting to the parade can be an adventure. It's easiest to arrive early using the CTA train. Getting to the parade close to the starting time is nearly impossible. You will watch jam-packed trains pass you by because there is no room for an additional body. Forget about driving because the streets are closed and parking is impossible. This year we found that riding our bikes along Lake Shore path was the best way to get to the parade (becau,3,9,6/25/2012,MI3wG3R12sQuTGdNvBBX3A,20,313,0

But they don't ever have sales on anything that I need. I had a fish ate a couple of the underwater frogs. So I came here to get more. There was a sticker on the tank that said they were under observation. I peeled the sticker off and bought both of them. I guess I should have waited. One jumped out of the tank and I found him about 6 weeks later all dried up. And the other one ate a fish the same size as him and died.

They've ditched their old beer selection and gone to a locals only variety.  How you gonna hate on that? The pizza is always solid.....perhaps one could argue that the crust is oily.....not quite as light as Some Guys or Baz.  But I still like it. Salads are awesome.  Home made dressing is awesomer. Decor...maybe its time to redecorate....or maybe just leave it until it becomes iconic and timeless. Never had a bad meal for Puccini's or bad service.......and with the improved beer selection it's gonna be hard to keep me away.,4,0,7/16/2011,gCQmTheUcBwaDVTp6U5pTA,1,48,0

The bartenders are always a lot of fun and I have never received bad service here.  The food is nothing to write home about as it does serve its purpose to get something in your stomach before you hit the alcohol. The crowd is usually pretty diverse and it is a typically a fun crowd.  You do have some really odd dirty old men who sit at the bar and stare at the women who are 1/2 their age or more.  It is a decent time but there is really nothing memorable for me to mention here which is why I only gave it the three stars,3,2,3/25/2006,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

We chose the dining room which is a nice big beatifully decorated room wihtt plenty of space between tables. Upon being seated a bowl of olives and freshly cut chunks of cheese are out on the table (Awesome). The menu is diverse offering something for everyone. I had a chicken dress with spinach and tomatoes which absolutely delicious. Siena Grill is truly a find and I will be back.

Recently I stopped in there with some gal pals and I was pleasantly suprise not to have to wait.That is pretty much my only complaint about the place is that its to damn popular and theres lotsa drunk people at 2 in the morning waiting in a tiny area to get seated.Oh yea its a 24 hour place so stop in to sober up anytime a night.  But anyways we were seated immediatly and ordered up some omelettes! I got the veggie and a side of hash browns. The omlette was the flat type and very well done which I appreciate I hate when the eggs are still wet eeek!

Jakeeno's had a sign outside of their place listing off specials and I thought to give it a whirl with the Italian Stacker which is off their menu but for $3dollars it was a steal the warm onion bun and the 3-4 different meats (i totally forgot whats on it) and the gooey cheese that strings out when you take a bite from the sandwich. I also decided to get a order of the cheese bread because it was a buck. Nothing special but it did taste good with the homemade marinara sauce to dip with.

The onion soup was a stand out for me as was the cheese burger. The french or steak fries tasted good and I'm assuming they are fresh and not frozen. Shillings is housed in an old building on the Marietta Square and may have been there since the Civil War. Old dark wood bar and creaky wood floors add to the ambiance.

BG7xTBPGjByq425D8ZNekA,5ITdf0mnklCpIUenv-5LWw,My review is for their philanthropy.  They opened their doors yesterday so that OneBrick and Yelp could prepare and serve meals to shelter residents from the area.  OneBrickers and Yelpers volunteered their time for one or more shifts...ranging from the dessert preparation on Wednesday night to prepping the dining room and preparing the meal to serving and clean up on Thanksgiving Day. I was there on Wednesday evening to help prepare desserts and again yesterday morning with my daughter to help prepare the meal and set up the dining room for the Thanksgiving feast.  The meal was prepared with all Indiana-grown products. The locale is easy to find and I loved the vibe.  I'm going to make it a point to return to The Earth House Collective for the cafe experience.

We had explored the city mostly on foot and couldn't complete the trip without a river/boat tour. The Wendella was a good price ($25 for 90 mins) and free with active military ID. We took the 1pm and the sun was high and 85 out. We first turned down and went towards the Sears/Willis Tower and was given some great background on the local buildings.. as well as a turn spot with a great angle for pics of the Sears/Willis Tower. We then headed back the way we came and was taken down to the Navy Pier and through the Chicago Locks and onto Lake Michigan.

We had to take a shuttle and it was spendy and took over an hour. i'm glad we weren't trying to do too much that night when we landed as we would not have made it in time. Nice and clean airport as well as having plenty of options available.

We all had a wonderful time and found this restaurant to be an absolute gem.,5,0,11/30/2010,pa5omruJjZEpBr1CzdUZ7g,27,249,0

My second visit I ordered the meatball appetizer and the roasted beet salad.  The meatball appetizer was delicious and I would get this again.  The roasted beet salad however was a bowl of spinach with a few sliced beets.  I like spinach but I wanted beets.

I've been here over a dozen times with many different friends and it's still great pizza every time I come.  Depending on what toppings you put together for your pizza you can end up with a somewhat bland pizza.  I'd definitely ask the staff about how strong the flavours are for some of the toppings you want to put together as some of the items are delicious but have a very subtle taste.

Every afternoon they have 2 for 1 ($9) Super Squishies.  I like the pina coloda  and the mango flavors.  Some of the others are too kool-aid tasting for me. If you don't know what a Super Squishy is then you need to watch more Simpson's reruns.  http://youtu.be/61kHpmen… A nice cold alcohol delivery system which is perfect for the hot afternoons in New Orleans.  There is no other reason to go to Mango Mango.  (Except maybe the bathrooms... keep your receipt.)",3,1,7/14/2012,1dFC0YhcvFu1ibPVYTkEfA,11,133,0

The only downer was the really cold service my girlfriend and I encountered when we walked in the door.  I have a feeling the wait staff here must have to deal with some really stuffy customers so I think they automatically put up this guarded attitude.  All it took was a little small talk on my part to get our waitress to settle in though and after that the service really was great.

bpUX6miAs-jy484SgE4Hew,1iJ4HoDOGSeIdyZQG6Qzww,This is my default gas station / convenience store.  I stop at this store 3 to 4 times per week and always have a pleasant experience...if you can get that at a convenience store.   I am a member of their gas frequency program so I always get $.03 off per gallon of gas...a big plus.  The store is always clean and bright.  The big draw for me is their fountain beverage machine.  I think the Diet Pepsi from their fountain machine is the best in Stevensville/St Joseph.  The price is the best too...$1.05 for a 32 ounce drink.   The staff is courteous and generally pretty chatty. I have never used the restrooms so I cannot speak to how they are.   They have fresh Krispy Kreme donuts delivered daily also.  I am usually there when the donuts deliver...timing is everything.,4,0,5/15/2012,1iJ4HoDOGSeIdyZQG6Qzww,83,192,0

This is what we found:     *Wonderful buffet at a reasonable price. Did not partake but will very       soon. You could see it was tasty...and for $24!     *Super clean inside (it is new!)....and smoke free.     *Mostly slots but we did sit at the roulette until our $20 was gone      (about 5 minutes haha)     *Looks like a good selection of draught beers. Did not catch the price       but I am sure it is reasonable.     *Open 22 hours a day every day. Closed from 7am until 9am.     *No free drinks when you gamble.....but blame that on the State. if       the casinos had their way of course they would provide free drinks.     *Free parking.     *W,4,3,8/14/2011,kMsX9ZxCfwgjZDEdCDej9Q,54,416,1

There is definitely a lot less teens etc at this theatre vs Scotiabank but it doesn't have as much to offer in terms of amenities but has all the essentials.  The good thing is that it doesn't have the price tag that Scotiabank does. The theatres are decent and clean.  The screens are nice but not as nice as some others in town and the theatres all seem pretty cozy.   Unfortunately for me I've never seen a movie in the VIP theatre and now I really want to after seeing all these reviews that mention it.,3,0,1/1/2012,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

I know they are a franchise but there is significant variation between this location and others I have tried. The pizza is great and they do not skimp on the toppings. The salad is nicely made with a modicum of care and doesn't look like it was dumped out of a industrial salad bag. The lunch specials are a good value...I had two slices (about the size of half a pizza) and a salad for $7.95.

That's what I felt like when I walked into here.  I mean from the outside it looks like an old run down building and that's pretty much what I expected on the inside but WOW there is a major contrast from the outside and inside.   The outside is very old looking and doesn't look well maintained.  The inside is the opposite.  If you're into architecture and churches then I can't see someone not liking this place.  However if you don't care ,4,0,1/7/2012,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

They have weekday specials with discounts on waxing. the staff is really nice and they ambience surprisingly takes you away from the yorkville excitement - you almost forget you're actually in one of the busiest parts of the city - super! the wax service itself wasn't that great. i wasn't satisfied with the service. The lady's waxing techniques weren't great and i strongly felt the service wasnt worth the discounted price. I understand the dim lights creating the zen like environment at the spa but it doesnt really work when you need to see all the hairs to get a good wax?!! just saying. i wouldnt return for a wax but would perhaps,3,3,9/28/2011,ZzA0SBWKSRJA8y5tlszrjQ,2,65,0

Labor & Delivery is very accessable from the elevators and on the 2nd floor of the hospital.  It is very welcoming with the colors they used. Mothers do not change rooms to have the baby and then change again once the baby is born.  They do it all in the same room.  The rooms are spacious and there are dividers if you need to tend to your baby and you do not want visitors to view.  They are all single delivery rooms so you will not have a roommate. The staff was very attendable and comforting in their words.  They have a great waiting room as well as goodies to snack and drink on while you wait.

Btb8hJa_ULJAM7WRScqC-Q,ZzA0SBWKSRJA8y5tlszrjQ,a fantastic dining experience!! its not five star because i personally don't like crowded places - its a small dinign area and the seats were so uncomfortable - i was seated along the bench by the window and there is no cushion - just a wooden bench. The food was so fantastic that the bench comfort level did not cross my mind during the meal but in my mind comfortable seating counts for rating as well. the food: what an act! loved every bite! Appetizers: 1. The buratta with roasted grapes - the cheese was so fresh and so delicious with the fresh bread and the roasted grapes - i fell in love with grapes all over again! 2. Bone Marrow with ox tail - this was my first time having either of those. Not really very adventurous with my food i gave this a shot - great bet!

I think the place has potential to be great and amongst brewery's locally I'd say this is probably the best in terms of beer selection and decent seating.  Other than that I'm not that impressed.

The food is simply delicious. It has that longed for home-made taste. The portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable. They serve (complimentary) yummy crispy garlic bread and garden-fresh salad. I usually get the Chicken Marsala with white rice. The wine and mushroom sauce is unbelievably tasty. My husband likes their chicken wraps that come with french fries. They make an amazing Three Milk Cake. It's very moist and has just the right amount of sweetness to it. The atmosphere is peaceful and serene. You can actually have a conversation with your party over lunch or dinner. I like the music that they play. I like that we never have to,5,15,8/2/2012,WuFA4HkgOpY0QADy3xwKvA,1,31,0

There are such odd little books like Flea Markets in Italy" but also books that you've heard of. The prices on the books were all between $5 and $10 which surprised me in most cases. I saw a design book in there that I assumed was around $30 and turned out to be about $9.

We also ordered the calamari which was not a large portion but tasty. We stopped by a second time on our trip and decided to try the hula pie which everyone on here says is AMAZING! I thought it was godo but not as good as everyone makes it out to be.

The streetcar to take you to the Garden District stops about a block away. Everything in the French Quarter is not a far walk at all. We stayed there a few weeks before Mardi Gras and the rates for this hotel were better than we imagined given it's location. The price we paid was an outstanding value. The hotel was showing obvious signs of some wear and tear but it was very clean and tidy. All of the staff did a great job and made us feel welcome.

bx3roA5nBjbnBWQmKubRmA,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,This is not a bad airport. My first issue is that there is no sign explaining that there is a bus that connects to the two terminals together. The signs all point you to the tram which is outside of security. So if you need to transfer from one terminal to the other its a pain because the bus was horrible or you could take the tram and go through security again. The next issue is that the place is run down and has bad food options in it. They also don't have nearly enough power plugs available. So people were arguing over the couple that were near where I was sitting. Next time I will go with the connections via DC so I don't get stuck in this hell hole.,2,0,12/14/2011,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,58,629,1

BXuxCoihxy53hmizUV2nTg,YomNW639BgIcOMwuS9LHcg,I used to travel for business quite a bit.  I've been to basically 3/4 of the U.S. and my modus operandi was basically to hit up a wing joint anytime I could.  After going to Buff Joes since I was a teen and experiencing the best wings you could only be disappointed going anywhere else which is exactly what happened to me.   There is no comparison.  Buff Joes hands down has the best sauce.  If they put it in a cup I would drink it through a straw.  And when there was not enough wing sauce to suck up through the straw I would tip the cup over and tap the bottom until every drop of sauce made it's way out of the cup.  The same applies to their ranch dressing.  It perfectly compliments their wing sauce. I can't say much about any of their other food as I've only eaten wings and celery here. T,5,0,8/7/2012,YomNW639BgIcOMwuS9LHcg,2,25,0

I've never had a sandwich with sprouts and I have to say I don't like it. i was kind of disappointed they did not offer any kind of chicken sandwich even subways and quiznos offers that. Service wasnt great the girl at the counter looked like she didnt want to be there and i could barely hear a word she said when i asked her questions.All in all pretty affordable for the amount of food you get Next time I wanna try a sandwich with 7 grain bread plain with just cheese and meat.,3,4,9/18/2011,DejbySADs66NO3RMAuzBIw,15,103,0

Jackson's is an easy walk over the bridge which was nice so we didn't have to take the car out of the garage. The seafood selections were plentiful of course and prepared with a good degree of imagination. The wine selection was really good as well. The waterfront location is really wonderful however on my recent visit it was far too cold to sit outside. On Friday and Saturday nights they also have a lively Night Club setup that is not to be missed if your in the area. Enjoy!,4,0,4/15/2012,pbyxWMCyRe8_NZihJToYKw,33,185,0
Bz6g0p73FawA3bXRQOozHQ,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,I popped in here for a meal tonight as I was in the neighbourhood and I wanted somewhere new to Yelp The restaurant sells itself as a Chinese and Thai restaurant though an examination of the menu confirms that the overwhelming majority of the dishes are Chinese in origin. I'm not sure how busy the restaurant is but the waiter seemed genuinely shocked when I walked in and he still looked surprised when I asked if I could have a table for one. I suspect a lot of their trade may perhaps be takeaway though that's a shame as the decor is quite well done inside. My heart rose when the menu arrived - it looked quite funky with a raised design on the front. My heart sank again when I opened it and the menu looked rather amateurly produced.

I have not been here in two years first of all.  The food here is decent.  It is a good short order place and the chili in the bread bowl was my favorite! The place never seemed too unkempt and the service was always consistent.   However...

The bread was warm with a cripy crust and soft center. We had two just to make sure. I started out with the tomato basil soup. It was overly spicy with chunks of tomato. Then came the antipasto salad. That was pretty good with chunks of hard salami and mozzarella balls. The homemade ravioli tasted like the store bought fresh. The sauce and the meatball had very little flavor. It actually tasted more like tomato than the soup. The portions and the prices rock. The service was great. I just need to try some of their other offeri,3,3,2/5/2011,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,356,927,0

After arriving at Toledo Express Airport - I stopped at the Hertz counter to pick up our car - checked in with the agent - who was friendly and efficient. She handed me the contract and keys and told me which way to get to the car. I love that you walk outside and just around the corner is your car - which of course is in stark contrast to the good bit of traveling you have to do to get to your car at larger Airports. Our car was an almost brand new Ford something or other. It was very low mileage - and so new it had that new car smell when you got into the car. There is no Hertz Gold Express service here - but that is okay as it is a small Airport. Ret,5,1,3/9/2012,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0

CaRw0BAYLNdPCHxjqW6eJw,pa5omruJjZEpBr1CzdUZ7g,Theater Square Grill is located in the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. They serve what I would categorize as American food with an entree or two for everyone. The food is always good. The service can be spotty because the staff has a tendency to become overwhelmed when serving a large number of meals in advance of a performance at the NJPAC. It can get a bit loud because of the very high ceilings. The decor is extremely pleasant. There is a full bar.

We had to run the dishwasher on items that were used but not cleaned very well at all. The beds in the villa were horrible! Please replace!

Restaurant has rear access. Hidden location next to Hotel 40" - draw your own connotations about what kind of Hotel that may be. Very friendly front counter person who sincerely took an interest in the restaurant and the food. Service was slow during lunch rush and some orders were delivered out of order. They probably need a second person helping out on the front counter during busy periods. Ordered a side of cheesesticks - only came with ranch and were average. Stick to the specials that will fill you up. Large dining room in front with one TV playing CNN covering Anthony Weiner-gate. Overall a nice find when I don't want to go to Broomfield.

I decided to go with a broccoli frittata with a side of bacon. It was delicious and hit the spot. The coffee was good and our server kept my cup full. She was also very patient with us as none of could could really decide what we wanted and offered some excellent selections to us. It is very unfortunate that we do not live closer to this place.

The ER facilities are very worn down and very crammed. Every seat in the waiting room was filled. I don't even know how long we were waiting in the waiting room. We finally were called into the ER and the wait continued. All of the rooms were full so they finally put her on a bed in a hallway. There was blood on the bed and on the floor by the bed. it was not a gush ,1,5,7/5/2010,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

cHxUaP7Se9Ej4CdzHEzxFg,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I was recently visiting on a lunch break and it was my first time to Juno. They have a good happy hour from what I've heard although I have not yet tried it. The lunch menu was limited & I ended up getting the french dip. It came with bleu cheese (which I'm not a fan of). The fries were delicious (and included even though not noted on the menu). The dip was not so good because of the cheese. It gave it a tang which I was not excited about. Did not have strawberry lemonade and waitress made it with strawberry flavoring for the desserts. Appreciated the guesture but wasn't the best.,2,1,4/25/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

This one is good because they have a drive thru open until 3am at least on the weekends. Last night we stopped by for some late night munchies and the people in front of us left the line so we got to the front and the lady charged us for the other people's food. When we let her know she had to grab a manager to come fix it which took like 10 minutes. The other people's food was like 4 dollars less than ours the manager refunded it and then charged ours. Then they screwed up and tried to give us the other people's food and had to tell them so they could get ours. I felt bad for the girl working and she was really sweet but the process took forever and made the line get really backed up the ma,3,1,5/13/2012,0GvJHXKM6p03h_fDNLI46Q,3,105,0

The ice cream here is much better than anything JP Licks or Emack serves up although I still feel Christina's has the best ice cream in Boston. The ice cream is very creamy and smooth. The flavors I tasted were all very good and the amount of selections was pretty wide. The sizes were pretty generous and I can't imagine getting anything other than a small. The prices were also pretty fair which I imagine are kept low to not scare off the college kids. The store was pretty nice inside and had plenty of seating available with a handful of tables as well. The staff were friendly and cheerfully answered all the questions and offered tastes of flavors without issue. The only downside to this place was if you drove to it as the street par,5,2,1/31/2011,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,58,629,0

On the way I found some other restaurants I want to try soon. When we got there we were greeted by the owner. He explained the flavored and had two items not on the menu. Then he guessed correctly what we were going to choose. My salted caramel was perfect. (my son had the same). Brownie cookie. My daughter chose the peppermint with a chocolate cookie. It was amazing that on a warm day the ice cream didn't melt so quickly that the cookies got soggy. Therefore the sandwich wasn't messy to eat.

Mind you I have had some off the chain turkey sandwiches until I went to this place. The bread they used was too tough and too thick for the way the sandwich was cut. I also was not happy with their partial menu which they should have had a full menu already available since this place went from being on regular hours to being seasonal having been situated on a golf course from its original location in Homewood. Most places I have been to that are seasonal have their full menues already available.

It is a little dive-y but I have to tell you it's so much fun. Yeah they have a burlesque show but it's very entertaining (it's done with class not dirty).

The menu hasn't changed much lately but its a hodgepodge of asian-inspired dishes to american to everything in between. The pad thai for an app is enough for 3 to share and the duck lo mein for a main course is very good.  Really like the beef satay too.  They also do a brisk takeout business. Reservations are a MUST during the weekend; its a small place and they will sell out.  But its also good for ski-kid friendly crowd.

The restaurant itself looks a bit dated but it still succeeds in evoking that romantic feeling with it's deep red and black murals boarding both walls and white linen draped tables complete with candle light and dim ambiance. There is an open kitchen in the back of the restaurant that allows you to view the chefs hard at work. Our waiter began by taking our drink orders. I was intrigued by the various flavours of San Pellegrino they offer and decided to order the Pompelmo (Grapefruit) flavour. It's delightfully tart and refreshing. I was surprised though when my table mate ordered a gingerale and it arrived in a can with separate glass?

cuJPL8Ew6wUjPSelIbyu9A,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,White Fence Farm is a seasonally operated place that closes down for the winter. The waiting room is a rather large antique museum that has some pretty cool artifacts.  The chicken dinners are served family style and you get a good deal of food for your money.  If you are looking for a side-splitting fun place than this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a place to bring the relatives from out of town than this is the place.  My only complaint is that they have a very limited bar if you want a drink. The chicken is a cut above all of the other places.  The meat is juicy and falls off of the bone and it has a very light breading that nearly melts in your mouth.  They have delicious steaks also.  They are very tender cuts of beef that are well seasoned.,4,1,3/29/2006,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

I was able to call on my way and make reservations of all us at around 11am which is a huge plus when finding somewhere to go with a group. We did not wait long at all for them to get our table set up. Once we were seated someone came over and asked the few of us that showed up first what we wanted to drink. After everyone arrived we all started deciding on what we wanted to eat. I choose the Strawberry crepes. They were just to die for. Just the right amount of sweetness to make the dish.

The main karaoke area is right by the bar and then they also have individual karaoke booths. I have met some really interesting people at the main karaoke lounge area.

I opted for the Cheeseburger Mac... Which I thought would be a larger portion due to the cost.. but ok. I can get over the size.  However the taste was just alittle too bland for me.  I'm not sure why they serve it in a bread bowl.. Mac and Cheese isn't the type of food that soaks into a bread bowl..

DO NOT come here. They refuse to accomodate military personnel in any room with two beds. So instead of a great rate for a returning soldier (190) you can instead pay more than you do on any travel site if you need more than one bed (415 was the quote for a double).Sad. You can have my priority club card back. PS your hotel front desk was just as bad if not worse than your 800 number rude staff. Trust me I will be telling everyone I know about this.

That said I've only stayed on the HHonors floor which is almost like a mini hotel inside the big hotel. It even has a separate check in area on the floor itself so you don't have to deal with the main check in area. The only thing I don't like about the HHonors floor is that the free breakfast is continental only while you usually get a free hot breakfast at most Hiltons with the HHonors floors. The hotel itself is in a great location and has all the usual amenities you would expect. The rooms themselves are average sized but look to have been very recently updated.

Just felt that the hair cut was a trim of a previously grown out hairstyle and not really an authentic styling. Prior salons typically straighten my hair after the cut and I leave feeling like it's a new hair style. Here it looked like a shorter version of my previous haircut. And not short enough at that.

Came here for the weekly family dim sum as my mom and aunts wanted to try out the dim sum here after having an enjoyable dinner here.  The place is pretty new and started serving dim sum in January after being an initial run of being being open for dinner only.  The interior is nicer than the storefront would lead you to believe and looks like it was converted from an old Italian restaurant.  It was pretty busy for a weekday morning in the cramped interior and I suspect the allure of cheap dim sum in a new joint resulted in the short lineups. This place works off the now-typical order sheet system (about fourty $2.50 items and other kitchen specials on the large menu) - so the variety is pretty good.

Try the Japanese hamburgers(Gabutto Burger) or any of the other hawker stalls. **Bring home some sushi. Best store made sushi in Chicagoland. The prices are right also. **Be on the look out for special events........sometimes they are carving s big tuna or specials in the Bakery section. **Take a stroll thru the fish and veggie section. Everything perfectly arranged and packaged. **Try whatever samples they may be passing out. You may like it!! **Take a stroll thru the alcohol section............and pray that they are passing out sake samples! **Check out the gift section. Good for unique treasures.

d5W1w4fGEZzi9KHipCFsKA,fJhQQKVrq2z_01PVEEDW4g,This place towed my truck from the levee parking lot while I was in Jake's Roadhouse on a football weekend.  They said I was not in Jake's even though I had a receipt to prove it.  They told me to take them to court if I had a problem with it.  They charged me $280 to get my truck back.  They said it was after hours pick up on Saturday at 1pm.  It's a scam to get out of town people to pay extra fees since they had a worker at the office with the door locked.  This place is terrible and they know you won't take them to court if you are an out of towner.  I wasn't going to take vacation time to go to court where a judge probably wouldn't show much lenience to a bar patron.,1,0,7/11/2012,fJhQQKVrq2z_01PVEEDW4g,27,103,0

I went this past Sunday and below is a list of things they had available for munching.  I also added comments on things I ate: * Bruschetta - Good. Bread wasn't soggy and had a good crisp * Spinach Artichoke Dip with Chips * Made to order omelets - I didn't have this but they had a lot of options for ingredients * Prime roast - It was a tad dry but not too bad * Sausage - Solid * Bacon - Crispy and good * Macaroni and Cheese - One of my faves from the brunch. Processed cheese with long spiral/elbow noodles. Yum * Fried Chicken * French Toast - Not a lot of flavor. Just a reg piece of bread dipped. It was eh. * Pancakes * Quesadillas * Ribs - These were really good. I liked the flavor of ,4,3,3/12/2012,GgZqf8LIFvi7rEsmYdAZoQ,4,101,0

d6VDNu-kIp5HX_PuiEfAjg,ZzA0SBWKSRJA8y5tlszrjQ,a pleasant experience! I'm not a huge spa person but was very tempted to actually use my benefits from work. After doing some research on yelp ofcourse i decided to book an appoinment at Toronto Bodyworks. They were so pleasant to work with. I got a call back immediately after i left a message with over 12 alternate time slots (the one i wanted wasn't available). As soon as i booked the appointment they sent me forms to fill out over email with directions on how to get there - they aren't kidding when they saypay close attention - the tiny little store front is really easy to miss. They even gave me a reminder call on thanksgiving day - appreciated! I wanted a really good massage for my bad back and that i got.

D7EdPYmTZJg6ggYDTE1Mug,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,Upscale bar/restaurant with matching prices! I did not have an opportunity to eat here (thankfully after seeing the prices). My gf and I went to the bar for 1 drink each. I decided I needed to try their dessert (Capp Cheesecake). It was ok. Tasted refridgerated and not fresh. 1 drink apiece and 1 dessert split cost us $38...pretty outrageous. Bartender was super friendly. Created the drinks himself (own personal ingredients). The place looked extremely stuffy and the customers didnt look nice (although the staff was very attentive and friendly from what we saw).

The food was just ok nothing special to write home about. The service was just ok as well. Nothing to great to talk about. The biggest compliant I had was that the place is so small. They really should have thought about giving people more room between tables. I was pushed numerous times from the table behind me getting up and down.,2,0,9/12/2011,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,10,92,0
d8-fsVZkM2jGG52By-TTDg,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I still take my car in for oil changes at this location when I'm in town visiting my folks. They used to offer a frequent stamp card for a free oil changed after 10. I thought that was a nice perk since oil changes are something that you need and can add up quickly. They don't seem to offer this anymore. They also close at 5pm which I think is a bit early. The oil change seems to have ticked up in price the last 6 months or so. Nothing exciting to report - free wifi but I wasn't able to connect as it sounded like the router needed to be reset but the girl didn't know how to do it.

The oatmeal bowl is my choice for breakfast and 1/2 sandwich and salad for lunch. The turkey cranberry sandwich is great.  The salads are prepared right there.   They also offer a reward program.

We've frequently had lunch meetings here and the place never fails to disappoint (in a good way! in a good way!). The restaurant is located at the east end of a strip mall at Clairemont Mesa and Santo Roads in Tierra Santa. Its hidden back from the road if you approach on Clairemont Mesa and easy to miss. Access from Santo is limited by a divider which requires Northbound traffic to head up to a signal and make a U turn. The restaurant is located next to a doughnut shop and shares the plaza with a large Vons and Mobil gas station. I'm boring and usually have the Spaghetti Bolognese?

DBE4lfs_E5u6OOsg0M03Vw,pa5omruJjZEpBr1CzdUZ7g,I went to Sofia's for lunch with 4 colleagues from work. Business people like to have a quick lunch and I would have to say Sofia's is not the place for that. It took over 10 minutes before a waiter took our order and then only because one of the members of our party flagged him down. There were only 4 other tables occupied so the waiter was not overworked. After we placed our order it took over a half hour for food to arrive. When it did only 4 of the 5 orders arrived. The 5th order arrived only after a member of my party went into the kitchen and tracked it down. Anyone else see a trend here. I will say the food was very good once it arrived. We were there almost 1 1/2 hours which is simply unacceptable for lunch. I won't be going back for lunch.,2,4,8/11/2010,pa5omruJjZEpBr1CzdUZ7g,27,249,0

The rocks have swirling whirlpools which are very alluring yet very dangerous. People swim here and have risked their lives. Many have died in the strong current. I think the count is up to over 20 lives since the 1960's. Their is a sign posted warning people not to swim. Other issues have poped up over the years.

I would recommend getting there right before you reservation.  We were seated around 10 minutes after our reservation time which was a little annoying as we had been waiting in their hallway for some time very uncomfortably already.

I've noticed that CeX has been expanding slowly but surely.

Food is alright... it's really cheap for the quality and portions you're getting.  Not to say it's good food - but pretty decent and far better than most of the cheap pubs around Granville.  And there is always a drink special.  It's like a independent knockoff of Cactus Club - decor and type of food is pretty similar - but cheaper and service is more amateurish.

As appetizers my boyfriend and I picked out the cheese puffs and the poutine. Both were delicious but I really enjoyed the cheese puffs. I am obsessed with beets and there was an abundance of cubed beets on the plate. The poutine had seitan in it and it was fantastic.

I almost always get the iced coffee or iced tea. $3.50 for a medium tea or coffee is ludicrious. Starbucks doesn't even go that far. The quality of their tea and coffee isn't at all worth it to me to spend that type of $$ either. The people behind the counter are fine and the tea/coffee is FINE...nothing stands out.

It's not exactly the greatest place to sit and eat. There are only a few tables there. They do have orders to go and it takes only $15 minutes. Lunch for my husband and I is only $12.50. Pretty cheap in my book. You get huge portions as well. I usually get the Teriyaki chicken with no veggies. It comes with Teriyaki sauce and also a spicy sauce and rice as well.

I started with their croqueta appetizers (three very big homemade) and it was delicious! I had the chicken Milanesa that I shared with the hubby and still had some to go. It was huge! From the other dishes that were coming out it seems that their portions are very big. We ordered a bottle of Champagne and when our waiter came back with the bad news that they didn't have that particular bottle I was devastated. He then took it upon himself to apologize and because of them not having the bottle I requested that a glass of their house champagne will be given to me free of charge. WOO-HOO! Score!!!

There are a lot of choices to choose from and why we picked this one was simply due to the right place/right time. We hoped on the boat with about 1 minute to spare. The top was full as expected since it was a picture perfect day. So we sat in the front in makeshift chairs. It did the job. The tour lasted about an hour. It slowly chugged along the Chicago River looped around and then headed to Lake Michigan. It was a great way to see the beauty of Chicago's architecture. A big plus was the ability to take a perfect shot of the skyline from a specific spot. You learn a lot about the history of the buildings during the tour.

They let everyone in around 4:00 but I would advise not going. It was so crowded we could barely walk. Got in line for a little roller coaster (the bigger rides had waits up to 2 hours) and the damned thing broke down. We waited to see if it would get fixed. They started taking people off the ride with a ladder and that's when we decided it wasn't going to get fixed soon so we got out of line. Trying to find an exit we walked to where we thought it would be and heard the roller coaster start up again. We tried to hurry back to get our place in line but that was difficult because of the crowd. We made it back and got on the ride.

Dk6s-RI6RQGe0p1Q7WzMVA,h51H-UsPhZgmPkdsjqz68g,I stood staring at the banjos for about 30 minutes yesterday. I tried to get the attention of the people behind the counter so I could try one out. I waited and waited and waited behind a line of high schoolers staring at the electric guitars. All those kids had guitars pulled down for them so they could go off into the corner and pretend to be rock stars. All those kids got helped but for some reason Walton's World of Music had no interest in helping me. Is it because I am older than 20? Is it because I am a woman? Is it because I only asked for help once? Either way I just stared up at banjos for awhile and finally left the shop. Next time I want to try out an instrument at Walton's I guess I'll dress up as a young emo child with swoopy hair and an empty wallet.,1,5,10/24/2010,h51H-UsPhZgmPkdsjqz68g,72,379,0

It seemed close to where we lived but neither of us could actually picture it. It wasn't until we got there that we realized we have seen the little coffee shop so many times walking by but never actually went in. It's a part of Freshi - so it just seems like an after thought attachment to the restaurant. I'm not a cappuccino drinker so really they didn't have to work very hard to impress me. I've had cappuccino only a handful of times and always found them bitter so i was a little reluctant to try it here. They reminded us that they are actually voted no. 2 on blogTO but they really were no. 1 and they were!

The lot is secure and the shuttle driver is right there behind you when yo pull in to collect you and your luggage right after you park. Picking up the shuttle after your flight is a breeze also. there were absolutely no glitches in transportation to and from the lot to the airport and vice versa.

It was sprinkling out but we sat on the outside patio underneath the roof. I walked inside the restaurant and told the server we were going to sit outside even though it was raining. We were having a serious conversation so we didn't think to complain but 45 minutes later nobody had approached us yet. 45 MINUTES! We finally waved down a server through the big front window and he took our order. I decided it was best to ask for the bill right away since who knows when they would have come out again.

Purchasing a drink allows you access to the buffet and I thought it was going to be chips and peanuts but when I walked up they actually had about 20 items ranging from risotto to different types of salad.  I've been told this was a larger selection than most places.  The food was ok for a bar buffet and the drinks weren't bad.  People are pretty rude in line when trying to get food so don't feel bad if you turn around and knock their plate out of their hand :)  They're literally right on your back and elbowing you at times,3,0,10/6/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

DoUOLRDa55chER1qrpe1Lg,J6jxfCx8p6VSOV5QvtH7Pw,The first time I'd been to H50 was back in the mid-90's. The hotel had just been renovated. The restaurant and bar were pretty but the food was not anything you'd write home about. However; H50 has a fabulous happy hour - 7 days a week - that I will gladly put to paper. My friend and I shared some sushi and spring rolls - which is no longer on the happy hour menu. That's unfortunate - because it was wonderful. We also shared the Painted Hills burger. It was very good as well. The décor is beautiful but you have to appreciate modern design. I especially loved the fireplace built into the wall that divides the bar and a seating area of sofa's and overstuffed pillows....and the windows.

Where they fall short is that it really doesn't have that downtown type feel. It still has that shopping mall kind of feel to it. Maybe they should have tried to go for a more of a retro look to the design. I was happy to see the Johnny Rocket's and Bar Louie and the Bass Pro Shop.

In bulk they are 80 cents at Costco. $2+ at a convenience store. Old Spice aftershave! Shaving cream. Microwave noodles (think cup of soup stuff). Wifey got a soap dispenser.

I'm completely obsessed with the gloomy little guy! The only sad part about this attraction is that it replaced Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. I realize that they weren't the most popular bunch for kids but I sure loved them! I love hopping around like Tigger and traveling through Pooh's nightmare of heffalumps and woozles! My favorite part is the cute little air balloon that opens up and lets you inside of it. Subtle but I like it. They just did a bit of renovation to the queue line while you wait for the ride. It's so much more fun now! There are some play games & an area for children. My favorite though is the interactive honey on LCD screens.

DSY_io3QXHfj9MyRdGKFPw,WgaycWkFXshvGtct42d_-w,I go to this place all the time. I go in with my new flatmate and her boyfriend. They are from New Zealand. They ask me and her for ID because we are buying booze and her boyfriend who's just with us. He only has a NZ drivers licence and they reject us. I'm 31. I can't buy goddamn booze without a hassle? Also I'm 31 will I really be hanging out with 18 year olds? There's a double standard here because people can go in with their kids and buy booze. If two people paying have ID and the other person is just with us we cant buy booze but someone with their kid and an obvious minor can. ME NO COMPRENDE BREWERY CREEK. You should ban children if this is the case no?

We had a family style party and among the selections: Lasagna = just about as good as I have eaten and only lacking in some earthiness. Sneak in some mushrooms and herbs and you would have an ultimate dish. Linguini White Clam = Bland. Was dying for sea salt and some pepper. My colleague were dumping cheese on it and every Italian on the planet was crying and moaning... I am sure of it.  lol Spaghetti Meat Ball = see my comment on lasanga. Chicken Marsala = delicious and I ate way too much of it.   : ) I even stole some shrooms and use them to pump of the other dishes.

Melted in my mouth. They do drench it a sauce with lots of greens. Partner had the Mahi-Mahi and she liked it. Definitely plus is that it's a BYOB. A little pricey but what do you expect with a BYOB.

We went in to get dessert and asked if the brownie was big enough to share - enthusiastic yes to our party of four (2 kids) it wasn't - it was literally a spoonful each or so - a 2 x2 in brownie that was gritty and not very tasty.  We also ordered a cookie dough milkshake priced the same as a well known vegan diner - but completely different - it was like melted vanilla ice cream- no frills and not worth the $5. It is a cute little place and I stress little because the server decided to clean the table next to us with something bleach like and it was pretty noticeable to the palate. All in it was $15 for a brownie and a shake that were disappointing - even the homemade chocolate sauce lacked luster.  With a great vegan option bakery around the corner they should think of,2,1,10/22/2011,fBP2Rsng1osoRBgyWx2kag,154,429,0

It was probaly 10 minutes or so before he acknowledged me.  Normally I would have bounced but the previous reviews were all so good and I have yet to find a really good japanese restaurant to get my fix. So I stuck it out for another 15 or so until my 14mo. old decided he would not hold still a moment more and there was a line of 3 people behind me... unfortunately I had to settle for McDonalds. yuck.

DZ2i_Gd2LVOk0wNT7qXVAQ,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,My husband & I drove out to Woodinville from Seattle to look at Paradise Pet Lodge because we had thought it'd be a nice place to keep our dog while we travel. We were surprised at how far it truly was as well as how things weren't as 'nice' as we had hoped they'd be. We came in for a tour and I was trying to not show how upsetting it was to see the dogs all barking & making lots of noise in every kennel. We were interested in the 'dog suites' since we thought it might be a little nicer for our older dog. These were completely reserved & full until after January and they weren't 'that' nice. The dogs looked sad and lonely. I'm not sure how often they allow the pets out of the cages to mingle and walk but we decided to pay a dog sitter instead. I know kenneling sometimes is the only option ,2,6,11/11/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

dZgwhCCrYj0oWBWw7Fid9g,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,So this place has a couple distinct areas for eating. The first being the patio in the back. Then adjacent to that is a large dining room. There is also a very small bar off to the side in a sun room. There is also a more formal main dinning room on the side. Lastly there is a pub/bar in the front. I ate & drank in the pub/bar area. The pub/bar is very casual and has a small bar with stools and about a dozen or so tables filling the rest of the room. The bartender was very nice and answered all my questions about the beers and food. For food I went with the appetizer sampler. It came with the usual selections of fried and deep fried foods. They were all pretty good. The only weird thing was everything came in 3 so splitting it was not as simple as usual. For beer I went with a ski of beer.,3,1,8/10/2011,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,58,629,0

One of the good things I love about their shoes is the fact that the grand majority are stitched discreetly on the sides.

They have so much stuff here and it pretty much covers everything from the 1600's to the present.  Some of the old artifacts that they have here are very intriguing.  I particularly liked the old rail car and the artifacts that were recovered from the Chicago fire.  I can easily spend a couple of day's in here going over everything with a fine tooth comb.,5,6,5/31/2007,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

I was eying up this place for a bit and Lara and Rebekah and myself tried this place out. To get the great big negative out of the way I will also agree that the vegetable plate was terrible. The flavors did not work well at all with each other making for a rather abysmal offering. The waiter was asked if there were any other vegetarian option available but the way he described the other option sounded very much like the menu item with the ingredients arraigned in a different way.

Westbourne Grove is a little treasure trove of wonderful food experiences but the Ledbury is a venue offering a slightly more upmarket experience. I was lucky to be taken there for a belated birthday meal by some good friends from medical school. The restaurant website gives a good idea of the dishes - classical French tradition married to some modern ideas and presentation. The staff were efficient and friendly and people were dressed in a mixture of casual and more formal wear. We decided on the tasting menu which had some unusual dishes on it as well as some old favourites. 1. The amuse of tomato essence was an excellent palate cleanser and got the gastric juices going nicely. 2. The ,5,5,3/17/2009,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,754,1693,0

We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait.. I feel like their menu is missing something or I probably thought their lunch menu should be bigger than 20 items. I wanted something light so I had the crabcake appetizer and my husband had the burge The crabcakes were pretty tasty. They weren't the best but they weren't the worst I've ever had. It came with some mango salad which was blech. The mango dressing was just didn't go well with the fruit. I wish I had the burger like my husband did.

We did the Wheel of Fortune machine which is a favorite of many and OH-SO-EXCITING when you get to spin the wheel! There are both 25 cent and $1 Wheel of Fortune machines and I tend to stick with the 25 cent machine so I can play the max lines of 5 for $1.25 a spin! I didn't do too well last night - lost $60!

The museum is located at Gate B on the plaza level and is open three hours before each home game until thirty minutes afterwards. Free during home games with a ticket to the game. There is a charge if you go during the week. The Hall of Fame museum announces new inductees each spring and holds induction ceremonies in the fall. This year Sammy Knight is the lone inductee. I love the Hall of Honors and the Evidence Room (to prove to us Who Dats who are still amazed that we won the Super Bowl). They also show footage of highlights from every season which is a bonus for those that never want to forget the past. Check out the museum before the game next time you go.

It was unreal to be swinging away at a ball and the background was cliffs and the Pacific Ocean. I mean the sun was shining and the cool breeze didn't make me break a sweat. I was truly spoiled and can never play any course in NY/NJ now unless it's 5 stars. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars because the place is a bit pretentious (which is what it strives to be).

eeMhCdIBJgwhapnkSGWPwQ,mcaJ_KyCXubJEM-jdSUMhg,I went to Caffe Vialetto after reading Yelp reviews on a business trip to Coral Gables.  I'm so glad I did! This is a pretty small place with a strange parking area in the back.  After valet parking it seems as if you are entering through the back entrance but it is truly the entrance to the restaurant.  Once inside the place is small and rather dark which makes it cosy and romantic for couples. I wish I would have remembered exactly what we ordered but I'm writing my review a month later.  The food was so delicious I'm sure whatever you get you will love.  I was pretty upset that I was unable to finish my meal or take it to go because I wouldn't be able to reheat it in the hotel.,5,1,5/7/2012,mcaJ_KyCXubJEM-jdSUMhg,2,68,0

EFm4n8-lND37Z5PUt0uYfA,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,I recently visited this Denny's because I received a 20% off or B1G1 coupon in the junk mail. This Denny's seems to be relatively newer. Perhaps it was built in the 90s or so and seems to be on an outlot of some motel. The place was dead on a Friday at 5:00 in the evening. We walked in and were greeted promptly. The service was efficient and our drinks never went empty but there seemed to be a rush here about 6 or 6:30 and the management only had the manager and 2 servers there for the whole dining room. We timed our visit just right because people coming in after us started to see a slow-down in service. The food was your typical Denny's fair and was decent by Denny's standards but I wouldn't rush back here again without a coupon. The server was excellent and there was plenty of parking. ,3,1,3/31/2009,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,294,660,0

Then I got the bbq chopped salad no chicken and my bf got the tostada pizza.Everything was meatless and delicious.

The store is huge considering the real estate in pricey Soho. They have two different levels of clothing sections. The sections are very nicely organised and each section carries a specific brand. I really like tees with some really cool and funny captions. I ended up getting two tees from here. The trial rooms located at the back were kind of strange with open doors and no mirrors inside the trail rooms. Some of the merchandise is expensive considering the sub par quality.

We were seated about 30 seconds before our waiter came over and introduced ourselves.  Asked if this was our first time and wondered if we knew what we wanted for drinks.  The service is excellent.   For dinner we started off with the bacon wrapped scallops.  These scallops melted in your mouth.  The size was a little small but they gave you 6 of them.  It was the perfect appetizer.   Husband had the sirloin and lobster tail with a baked potato.  All I heard throughout th,5,1,2/7/2011,jgPOl8penY4km_zdEYRAhg,10,169,0
EI9Wd2mJMPfb_vV6hBuvqA,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,We started one of our nights here and ended up getting this beer that I can't get in Canada.  It was a nice beer and I think it was a Grimbergen Blanche.  The place was pretty packed but it was the night of Nuit Blanche. We sat outside on the patio/street and boy was it lively out.  The neighbourhood that this bar is in is busy and a little bit dirty but man I like that. I found one of the 2 staff members that served us a douchebag but the other one was pretty cool. I have no idea how their food is but judging from the 5 reviews that gave this place a poor rating I'm assuming not good :),3,0,11/10/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0
eicJR-WxTMDcqTXBBFuwYQ,zAddDr8fzyTV-YB2wSoWTA,I absolutely LOVE this place. It's set in a narrow little street and I was lucky enough to park right in front of the building. It was early after noon and past lunch hour so it was fairly quiet. I picked a little table upstairs where I have an excellent view of the whole restaurant. Friendly staff. I ordered crepe with duck confit and the portion size was just right for me. For dessert I had chocolate caramel tart which was really yummy. There were a bunch more that I was wanting to try but I know that I will be dropping by this place again at some point.

I was not disappointed!! We had come to KC to attend the KC Sporting Soccer game for the first time and we were very eager to eat at CIP.  We got a table the moment we walked in and the atmosphere was very Buffett.  It gave you a good vibe.  The menu has a varied selection and their fries are endless if you order a burger - needless to say my husband took advantage of that.  They use a good seasoning on their fries that say give me more".  I ordered a Caribbean jerk wrap and it was very good as well.

ELMx3cZxU_aSreWDvT2ZDQ,5Y5KbsI5buMcNh2hTFaRpA,The recent grand opening of the flagship store for Judith Bright jewelry in Green Hills Mall was a success! I popped in on opening day and there was already a cluster of well-heeled ladies gushing over the selection of handcrafted baubles! JB's store's design is contemporary and fresh with all the focus on the pops of jewelry merchandised throughout this small space. I zoned in on a selection on 14k gold gold rings with large vivid stones as the centerpiece. It may be THE perfect cocktail ring priced at around $198. A gorgeous silver bracelet caught my eye and was totally budget-friendly at just $78 while a striking gold waterfall necklace priced at $398 is something that I can certainly work towards. Overall the pricing opens up the door for most budgets with pieces ranging from $16-$600.,4,4,11/17/2010,5Y5KbsI5buMcNh2hTFaRpA,94,580,0

Last time it was insanely slow and the girl making my sandwich overcooked the English muffin where it was so hard it was a chore to eat. This time my sandwich was a mess (as posted in picture). The eggs were hanging off the sides and vegetables in disarray and none of it was toasted as requested. And it's different people every time.

But it was very relaxed inside and not what I was expecting after seeing it was in a shared space with other businesses. . The interior is full of bright colors and artwork with the bar and tables in the front and sitting area in the back of the brewery. They make about nine beers in house and I tried their Sunna beer (Belgian Wit) but wasn't feeling it so I went with Shipyard Pumpkin ale.

That says to me the place may not get a whole lot of business. On top of that - after all of that - the ATM returned me an Out of Order" message when I attempted to use it.

I was told by the hostess they were fully booked however she gave us two options: 1) Go on the waiting list for a table which could be up to 1hr+r wait (The hostess advised that there has never been a night when 100% of the reservations actually showed up so we could get a canceled table if that was to occur) 2) We were offered a table that was for an upcoming reservation that hadn't arrived yet only catch is that we had to be done eating by 7:30pm however we were also put on a waiting list in case a table opened up We took option 2 I figured we could never finish eating by 7:30pm and they couldn't possibly kick us out right?

f7cuQUpJXV394ASu3PD4eQ,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I have to give props to San Fran for having a pretty efficient airport. From the Airtram to get to the BART and the services offered inside the airport itself. It was clean and the security checkpoints didn't seem to have as many 'random - aka everyone' body scans that Seattle's airport does. Knocking one star down due to TSA. I was happy to see that SF was an airport that allowed mobile boarding passes with AK Airlines. You'd be surprised how many 'major' airports don't actually offer this option and I like being able to use my phone and not having to get a piece of paper that'll be shoved in a bag after 5 mins. The TSA gate agent couldn't figure it out and so she sent me back to get a paper pass. What is the POINT of having mobile boarding passes if I can't use them?

I got to the Delta ticket counter and they didn't like the way the paperwork from United looked and said I had to go get them to reissue it and then come back.

I love the fact that there are electrical outlets - one can plug in to standard AC outlets and charge any devices that need juice! The restrooms are huge compared to those on an airplane! 2 hours and 45 minutes from Union Station to Penn Station. Just be careful walking through the cars - especially if you go for a beverage or food - the train can be a bit bumpy at times.

fcN1YPtDPWOSjRCMljVsUw,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,Wal Mart opened its first express store in the Chatham neighborhood today and it was a very interesting experience because it's a scaled down version of the typical Wal Mart store. It's basically geared towards people getting the things they need such as toiletries for the house and food versus the Wal Mart store where you get anything and everything there. It's also situated in an area where it's needing accessable stores because not everyone owns a car and some are having to do their shopping trips on public transportation. I live about 10 minutes away from this store and it's convenient when I don't feel like shopping elsewhere and dealing with the crowds which is pretty common for Wal Mart.

Maybe it wouldn't of been so bad if I hadn't been to stores before that had nice comfy chairs. And maybe it wouldn't of been so bad if most didn't look the chair in my grandma's basement.

FENhSu4qjXoGEQJBuuis_g,ZhBppt_sn8CNJ76PbZeMyw,I have always enjoyed Quincy's food. It is pretty good quality and the service for the most part was efficient. But one incident irked me. I was here for lunch while my brakes were being repaired down the street. I order a tuna melt deluxe (which I assumed came with soup because the waitress asked me what soup I wanted). I had to ask three times for the soup and it never came. I did get the bill and was billed for the deluxe. The waitress then told me that I didn't get soup. Needless to say I paid $9.50 for a tuna melt sandwich. I haven't been back since. It's a shame because their menu items are yummy but I don't like to be billed for items I don't order.,3,1,7/23/2010,ZhBppt_sn8CNJ76PbZeMyw,74,346,0

When we arrived they sat us in the very front in the bar area.  There was a little card waiting for us on the table that said congrats on being married.  WTH???

My colleague and I always choose something a bit more upscale on our last dinner in town on business trips and we were very happy with our choice to dine at Tommy V's. The wine selection to start was good and had some off-the-beaten-path" choices. The plates were equally wonderful. My colleague is a sucker for pasta and therefore chose the Carbonara. I had a taste and thought it was very nice. Not as creamy as Carbonara is usually served on the East Coast but really nice. Very flavorful and just a tad lighter than normal. I had the Sea bass and it was very tasty with the lentils. The service was good and the premises very clean and attractive.

The boxes of peanuts they have in the place makes for a fun little snack while you are waiting for your food. The decor is nothing special and the staff was friendly and efficient. I couldn't ask for anything more. I would agree with the fact that this place is an outstanding value. You get more than your money's worth when you order your meal from here. There is nothing special about the burgers here and what they put on them.

The John Barleycorn lives up to it's name.It's a good match and mix of sport's bar and a dancing club. It has two floors with ground floor having a sport's bar kind of look. It's very spacious with a big bar in the centre with ample sitting capacity. The first floor is the actual dance club with huge dance floor. The crowd is normally very good out here. They have big flat screens on all the walls which plays the video of the song played by the DJ.The bartenders are very friendly but sometimes it takes ages to fetch a drink. Overall nice place to hangout with friends on a Saturday night. Beware: They don't allow people with hats inside the club.

FhqheMMVbq1gqaE3FyB5Pg,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,The pizza here was quite different to say the least.  The sauce was very sweet and the topping were place on top of the cheese instead of the other way around like I am used to.  The crust was wafer thin too which made it very difficult to eat.  It was not bad but not exactly to the best of my liking. I had one of their honey ales and it was very good.  It was a very light smooth ale with a very good taste.  Our server was a little on the odd side but she was friendly  and got out food quickly.  She did get rather annoying after a while as she laughed after every sentence that she finished regardless of if it was funny or not. Very odd.,3,0,9/18/2006,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,1

As always with a lot of Targets the check out (regardless if it's busy or not) is a hassle. Never enough registers are open. It's a bit hidden in the back off of Route 10. Prices are the same as others. Same layout. What else can I say? It's Target.

I've used House Call since I bought my old house in 2000...except they had a different name then that I can't remember.  They even tented my house for drywood termites in 2004 (maybe).  I've always found their workers to be highly professional and punctual.

This is one of the smaller Old Navy's I've been to but that might have been because it's under construction.  The staff was friendly and I went around to see their collectibles t-shirt line.  The selection here seems really limited compared to the last 2 Old Navy's I've been to and again I'm not sure if it's because of the construction.   Unfortunately I wasn't able to find the t-shirt I wanted.  I hope the store gets larger after their construction and they have a larger line of collectible t-shirts that I've seen at other Old Navy's.,2,0,3/14/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0
fiP0piRLMRaONFvjyB8MeA,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I have to admit that I was surprised by this Korean BBQ joint inside Uwajimaya's food court. My husband & I came here before the Seahawks MNF game and were pleased to see Korean food as an option. There was a sign that folks headed to the game would get 10% off their order with a valid ticket. That was just an extra bonus! We ordered (I had the kalbi & rice; husband had the spicy chicken & rice). The owner (or the gentleman running the counter) was so friendly! It seemed like everyone knew him and he was so concerned I was going to be super cold at the game. He conversed with us and other customers as if we were all friends. The food took a little longer to make as it is made fresh and by one cook. But it was well worth the wait!

I went there last weekend before the Colt's first preseason game and I guess the new feel of the bar must be wearing off because the crowds were light.  It seemed the staff may have taken new jobs at Tilted Kilt.....   My buddy and I were sitting at the bar and I noticed that a bar back was putting several draft beers in the refrigerator below the bar.  I asked the waitress what he was doing and she said he was preparing for it to get busy.  Well that never happened and some of those beers,3,1,8/15/2012,fJhQQKVrq2z_01PVEEDW4g,27,103,0

The bar is cash only and I have to say I liked that they encouraged you to pay for each round as you go so you don't end up forgetting how large your tab has grown to. I know I've had to make the emergency run to the ATM in cash only bars before for this exact reason.

fkl4kNJdeV0p3WzgttlpvA,0GvJHXKM6p03h_fDNLI46Q,This place has a nice view and good service. We stopped by for lunch and the patio is a nice place to sit and look out to the water. The waitress was nice and efficient They had a 2 course lunch special for 17.95 which was clam chowder and sole in a lemon caper sauce over mashed potatoes. My boyfriend:ordered this and I got the pizza of the day which was shrimp with arugula and cheese. We decided to share everything. The clam chowder was Luke warm and missing sea food. It was all potatoes. The sole was well cooked but lacking in flavor. The pizza was great! Lots of shrimp and flavor. We didntt make it through the pizza and so I asked for it to to go. This is where it gets a little wired. The waitress grabbed the plate to go put it in a to go container. 10 minutes later we had paid the bill,3,0,6/13/2012,0GvJHXKM6p03h_fDNLI46Q,3,105,0

I was a bit disappointed with how little stands were out.  I might have gone during low season and a lot of stands were gone but I'm not 100% sure.  There were a main strip of stands that sold leather goods and scattered between each leather vendor were people selling tacky souvenirs and jewellery.  Around this main strip of booths were other scattered booths selling what seemed to be knock off items of knock off clothing which seems strange ;) Don't get the wrong if you're here for leather this might be the place for you as there were a lot of booths" selling leather but they all seemed to be extensions of stores that were located behind one of the booths.

My daughter ordered a 'lunch sized' salad -- which was huge.  My son-in-law ordered a pork sandwich -- which was huge.  I ordered the chicken avocado club -- which was huge.  We also ordered the kid-sized Mac & Cheese...that lasted for 3 meals for the cheese-loving baby.  We all took food home to have later for dinner.

fm7ShnNiGa3T4SdxjGFnYQ,PFNZVn73upq3oZDG2KnAqA,I believe this restaurant is definitely a hidden gem amidst the slew of restos clustered in the downtown core. Located inside the Renaissance Hotel which is attached to the Roger's Centre / Skydome it boasts a spectacular birds eye view of the entire field down below! The whole entire left side of the restaurant is lined with floor to ceiling windows with tables bordering it which are prime locations to watch the game. Yes that's right! You can have a lovely meal and watch Blue Jays Game down below for FREE! I suggest making a reservation to ensure you get a table right beside window. The restaurant itself is very airy feeling with white tables and walls and comfy colorful retro chairs. When the game starts the waiters turn the TV's on to the game and broadcast it throughout the restaurant,5,2,6/1/2012,PFNZVn73upq3oZDG2KnAqA,14,137,0
Fmayf2IyjdGVfC0eYZZ-pw,wkrFqNxwTEEkG3mJV88Izw,I LOVE Los Gorditos and this brand spanking new location is now my favorite location to visit. These are my reasons why this is my numero uno spot: * Nice seating area with plenty of seating options. * They accept Debit & Credit cards here (not like their other locations). * Clean and awesome Salsa bar. They even have Broccoli or other veggies to company your meals. * Friendly service. * You can still get all delicious food like their other locations (Vegan soy curl tacos are my favorite) and their prices are the same. * Another affordable dining option for the Pearl district area.

They were quick to help me find another one in the color I wanted. (I wanted the same model different color b/c for some reason I think it is bad karma). They had it shipped here. They also helped me tremendously processing my gap claim and all that. I ended up repl I ended up getting a year newer (08) cheaper than I bought my (07) and with more accessories. I only take it here for service too. My service guys I have dealt with are Rich and Matt. Both SUPER helpful. I hate waiting on my car to get the oil changed and tires rotated so they even had someone give me a lift to the gym (since it's less than a mile away.) so I could workout while I waited.

I had the shrimp & crab sandwich.  It looked like it was served with an ice cream scoop and dumped on a hamburger bun but was OK.  I had to add lots of pepper because sadly they had no hot sauce. The cole slaw  pretty goood and the waffle fries were OK.   I had to hunt down my waitress to order but she was pretty on the spot after that.  Big minus for the chemical tasting ice tea.

The things I love at Big Boy is their buffet: the lunch/dinner buffets as well as the Sunday morning breakfast buffet. There is almost nothing bad I could say about the buffets: its cheap and definitely worth the $ you spend. The reason why THIS PARTICULAR Big Boy only gets 2 stars is related to service. I've been here a few times and every time the service has been HORRIBLE. I have a feeling since my friends and I are college students they are under the impression that we don't care about service or they have a feeling that they are not going to receive a good tip BUT that is far from the truth.

Fnp3MUjk8q0yH6XeYuiLQw,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,This T.G.I. Friday's is located right in Penn Station. We had dinner here one evening before jumping on the Acela Express bound for DC. We were seated in the far back of the restaurant - and then forgotten for a period of time by the wait staff. Lots of staff passed by us - none of them willing to make eye contact. We finally flagged someone down and asked if anyone could take our order. Friday's is now printing nutritional information on their menu - I was shocked at how the calorie counts were for much of the menu. I ordered one of the lower calorie items - a grilled Cajun shrimp dish with steamed broccoli. Food was adequate - service was adequate - once we had gotten their attention. I doubt I would come back here again.,2,3,7/18/2010,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0
FnTjNQ5F9z6X_Lrm839Ljw,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,An ex boyfriend I dated in high school took me here on a date and I believe he planned it after remembering that I liked persian and middle eastern food. This was a sunday brunch buffet and it came with a complimentary glass of champagne-which was good since it was the good kind. Champagne should have a good taste and it wasnt like the ghetto stuff where it tasted like battery acid and it was watered down. The food was really good and worth the price paid. The service was really good and I noticed that I didnt have to ask my ex to be moved to another table when we were seated at a table and it was too sunny. My ex called the manager over and asked to be moved to a better table. He happily obliged and called members of his staff to prepare the table for us.

fognYkjhcydhR6kJw3fucg,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,My husband and I chose this restaurant since it was BYOB and we wanted to try something different. We heard it was a good place to celebrate and so I booked a reservation for the night of our 1 year wedding anniversary. The parking lot was really bad as the stalls were very small and compact. The restaurant is located in the rear so you have to make sure you find the right entrance. It is located in a strip mall with other restaurants nearby so it's good to know if you end up wanting to eat something else. Our waitress was great and we brought our own wine which she kept chilled at our table. The restaurant wasn't too busy and there really was no view so that was disappointing.

FRSS5Kq1qHMfA-BV4NPZTg,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,My husband and I have been on a health kick for the past year or so but cupcakes seem to be our weakness. We've taken to trying out all the cupcake stores and seeing which we like best. (It's horrible; I know). Cupcake Royale was definitely on our 'to do' list and we happened to be in Bellevue Square and decided to come visit. It is located off Bellevue Way which is a block or so over from the mall but they do have plenty of parking. They converted an old IHOP so it is shaped like a house and has several ways to enter the establishment. We were greeted quickly by the two guys working the counter. They had a decent selection of flavors (I believe there were 6 'daily' staple flavors and then 2 flavor of months and special flavors). The prices are on par with the rest of the cupcake places (a,4,0,3/11/2012,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

I came there to get my grandmother's medication OK they tell me it would not be ready until 5:30p and then when I came back at that time they tell me again it's not ready and wouldnt be until 8:30. OK this is what irritated me because to listen to my grandmother piss and whine about her medication wasnt benefitting me running back and forth running down my gas and patience.

I can recommend the pulled pork sandwich and the pork tacos. Both were excellent and both came with meat that literally melted in your mouth. Add on some additional sauce and you are in heaven. Fries are a mixed bag here - either soggy and lifeless or fresh out of the fryer and excellent. Soft drinks are refilled without even having to ask and you will get 2 honey rolls that come out with your meal. I wish they were closer but that just makes the trek to Stapleton a special treat.

Most of the art displayed here is dedicated to the architecture of medieval europe which was assembled from the architectural elements. It is very easy to get to via public transportation though it the train takes a while if travelling from lower manhattan.It is nesteled in the fort tryon park. It was nice to see art works from ninth to sixteenth century which were displayed here from medieval europe era. The medieval garden located within the museum is a place which is so calm and brings out so much peace.

I was very excited when I saw that it was down the street from Downtown Disney and we pulled in to eat. We were quoted about a 30-45 minute wait (Friday night) and we went and sat in the bar. The bar was small and had 4 booths and many small round tables with bar stools. It wouldn't have been able to let us eat and so after some of the booths cleared - we asked our waitress/bartender if we could move to the booth. She told us that it was counted as part of the 'waiting list' but she would let us take it (we found out later that it wasn't true as others were grabbing tables without any pushback from the other waiters/bartenders).

As the others have said security is crazy -- but come on -- it's 2010 -- get used to it. We came with almost nothing in our pockets (my wife with no purse). Would I go back?

If I were rating this place on the beer alone - I'd give the place 4 stars. Not all the beers were great - but good enough to rate it four stars. What dragged the rating down a bit for me was the food. I've had the chicken wings - they were a little to soft for me - I like the skin to be crispier. And the wings were not very hot - it's like they cooked them then let them sit for a bit before bringing them out to me. The Nachos are also okay - nothing wrong with them - but also nothing to write home about and rave. They don't offer Guacamole to go with the Nachos - instead they offer a small souffle cup of something that tastes vaguely like watered down avocado paste - no real flavor or character to it. ,3,1,12/21/2010,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,1

FyGNffjuFCQtqf3ODxPD0Q,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,I went here on Saturday night and ended up closing out the place. So I take that as I sign I enjoyed the place. The wine selection was pretty diverse and the prices were very reasonable. We ended up going with a bottle of the Sangiovese and enjoyed it very much. In fact we even ended up getting a second bottle. I didn't try any of the cocktails and honestly I wasn't super impressed with the selections. Perhaps I've been spending too much time at Eastern Standard and experimenting at my house at this point. I really think that for a place that claims to be a destination for classic cocktails they might want to have more than they offered and certainly some selections that were a little less mundane. For food the only thing I tried was the Rosemary Scented Roasted Eggplant & Feta Dip with to,4,6,3/1/2010,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,58,629,0

The rooms were updated but the hallways were gross.  Breakfast was also horrible.  I ordered an omelet and it came cold and tasted wrong.  I left without eating.  It was really bad.  I got a coffee and ate somewhere else.

Water attractions were fun (especially if you're a kid) and the resort is a huge massive place with a variety of types of rooms and accomodations.  I will say that the food on site isn't that great and it's awfully expensive but I guess they feel they have you trapped and you're not going to head off campus" in your wet swim gear with the kids to grab lunch. We were here off-season of course so the rooms were very inexpensive and well worth it.  I can see that Aidan will have a blast the next time we go.  They are very accomodating and friendly throughout the resort and the check-in process is about as simple as it can ",4,0,10/6/2008,WZq0FC-0HS6_R4pKUy_3Ig,58,225,1

The wine list is extensive and interesting.  I'm not a sophisticated oenophile but suspect the average wine drinker would be happy.  I had a Pinot Noir at $8.50 a glass and the glass was huge!  The pour was probably 6 oz. but the glass was big and square-round and very elegant.  Steve had one of the two local offerings - Upland Dragonfly IPA - only $4.00.

I was glad I 'Yelped' ahead to get a feel of what items would be offered as well as to discover they only took cash. One star ding for that since it is a pain (who carries cash around anymore?) They have their own parking lot which is great since Ballard is always a pain to find (and pay) for parking on the street. The place was pretty empty when we came in for dinner and the food was made fresh after we paid. The burger was delish although I had it sans special sauce" as I am typically picky but it didn't make the burger dry or bland without it.

G4YcQwNqc9EhyMBbna12iQ,WKpzoB_oom4OSEe703-uxw,One of the best things about Capriccio is that it is not located near the tourist mecca known as Celebrity CIty.   At 7:40p on a Sunday during tourist season the wait at restaurants in CC was 1.5+ hours.  At Capriccio we were seated immediately by a friendly waiter (Mike) that was appropriately attentive throughout the night. We had three glasses of house wine.  Although inexpensive both the Chianti and Pinot Noir were very good.  The Merlot was acceptable.   We had the Mozzarella Caprese appetizer as well.  It was good. Our group had three dinners.  The first was an awful Cajun/spicy chicken.  It was HOT HOT HOT and nothing positive can be said about it.

The Basilica is beautiful both inside and out so its worth spending a little bit of time around.  You'll be walking uphill for a bit so take your time but do walk it.  Avoid the locals who are trying to sell you things as they are very clingy.  Once you're at the top ENJOY the view and hopefully the weather.

It costs $1.50 to ride the trolley - you insert your dollars and coins in a little machine right by the driver - and then he hands you a ticket stub that more closely resembles a cash register receipt. For some reason - our driver was a bit grumpy and surly - our group seemed to enjoy his crankiness. Those trolley cars go faster than you think! We hit this one section of track and we all looked at each other and discussed the fact that we were passing cars and we were surprised at how fast we were going.

They have tons of sauces and veges to top their average burgers. What makes the burger is their freshly made on the premises bread. The fries are seasoned but they don't give you many. They have melted cheese selection to top the fries which makes them even more appetizing. The wings are not good. Dry and the bones fall apart which means they always over cook them. They do serve dessert and have made to order shakes which I have not tried. Beverages are refill able and do it yourself. They also serve alcohol but I always go during lunch.

Gravel parking lot in front with access to the restaurant only being marked by an OPEN sign near one of the doors. Friendly service inside the restaurant though a small sign taped to one of the pictures on the wall as you enter reminds you to turn off your cell phone ringer. Sat down and noticed some stray flies inside the restaurant. Isn't there some kind of health code on that? Annoying to have to keep swatting away flies as you eat. I ordered a basic burger and fries and a side of onion rings. Basically if a place can make a great burger chances are they will excel in other areas.

G7nlEmCP5O7Ed59bw3XQUw,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,While I was a skeptic about the whole hypnotist thing I ended up being pleasantly surprised. The show kicks off once you are sitting as you have music playing and a 3D screen on. Once everyone is seated the show begins with Anthony and his friend talking about the opening of the show. Since it is in 3D they have various things that are pretty cool like a Yo-Yo coming out in the audience. Once the actual show begins Anthony is introduced and then talks a little about hypnotists. After he goes over some ground rules he asks for volunteers. In my group eight of the ladies went up and five of them were kept up the whole show. Now he starts hypnotizing everyone on stage and asks that the audience in quiet. During this period people in the audience may become hypnotized as well.  We had one lady,4,3,3/14/2012,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,10,92,0
G7PDL0TfY55ZwegSgz12yg,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,The Gift Shop located inside the Embassy Suites hotel on Paradise Road. As hotel-based gift shops go - this is one of the lower end ones I've had the displeasure of utilizing. The place is intermittently closed - there will be a sign on the door advising one to go to the front desk and they will call someone. Twice I did this - and each time you are waiting 5-10 minutes for someone to show up. The selection is also somewhat meager compared to other gift shops. I got a snack late one evening to go with some bottled water and diet soda - some Cheetos - and they were stale and disgusting. Better to walk next door or down the block to the Speedee Mart of the 7-Eleven for more and better options.,2,1,3/13/2010,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0

The dam is one of several on the Gunnison River. We accessed the dam from the downstream side via National Park Service access point. It's always kind of weird being close to the base of these dams - I always get this strange sense that the dam is going to breach with me down there... After all - the The Cimarron fault is approximately 1 km from the dam.,3,1,5/5/2009,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0

I am 22 now lol I was finally able to go there in Feb (2010) and since it is after all called Tom's Oyster Bar.. i was super exicted to try the Oysters. One word: dissapointed. The oysters were small and some of them looked smaller than an M&M. I had fish as a main entree and the waitress recommended that I get it medium well and it was extremely undercooked !!..The edges of the fish has a nice crispy texture but the core was simply raw !!

Even before I got to the counter and before either one of us uttered a word. Maybe it was because I was messing around with my phone. I stopped with my phone and smiled at her (trying to warm her friendly side). It didn't work. It seemed as if I was still bothering her.

Taco Bell food is never that great to begin with - but I suppose I get the occasional urge and the nearest Del Taco is in Encinitas (at least the thugs working the counter add to the excitement and eye candy there and the food is better too!)

I scanned the reviews and agree with the 1 and 2 star ones. They serve the burger terribly by putting it at the bottom of their greasy sack of fries and nothing to put it on to eat it there. The quality is fair but not better and the workmanship" on the burger is less than acceptable. The fries are abundant and mediocre and the price for all this is very high for the value received. The only plus are the peanuts and unlimited drink to wash them down with.

I saw a watch online and the website said Kay Jeweler had it. I went to the store and the told me they didn't carry that specific model. I almost left but I decided to let them show me other watches by the same maker.  They were patient with me as I whined about what I didn't like about the designs or what I did and made suggestions.  I felt really comfortable and not pressured to buy that day.

gF6-AwLLZI-T436P6yIRsQ,OiBmu84gTMZhWqDi2PXhCQ,This is my home airport.  I'm a business traveler out on flights about twice s month.  My first reason I really like this airport is I'm only 10 minutes from home when I land in the evenings but that's a plus for me and any local people.  ONT is primarily s commuter airport.  Monday mornings in terminal 1 may look like chaos but the vast majority of people catching the 5 - 7am flights are regulars and the 300 person security line moves quick.  These are mostly the cattle car Southwest flights up to northern CA or out to Phoenix.  I'm a United flyer so I leave from terminal 2.  Usually not busy at all.  Especially the premier lines for check in.  Another great plus is they let premier through the security area. Up to the escalators.  After that you need to just wait your turn.  Waits in ONT,4,0,9/11/2012,OiBmu84gTMZhWqDi2PXhCQ,5,88,0

The establishment is clean and they do give you decent portions of food. I've been here to lunch plenty of times. They have a decent lunch menu but it is still a little bit higher in pricing if you were to compare it to other Thai places. I always change it up whenever I eat Thai food. I had the Pad Kee Mow with pork along with the pork egg rolls which comes as a lunch combo. I had it as mild since I noticed that number two in the Spice rating which is on the lower side is apparently quite spicy. I didn't want to sacrifice flavor with heat. I also had Thai tea which was pretty good and was served in a large glass. We ordered dessert. We had the fried bananas with the coconut ice cream an,3,0,8/25/2012,gWrfDg97-1GtQVVUhuUKBQ,1,123,0

What was also very unprofessional was the security guard going in on this woman as well when he too was acting unprofessional. I seriously thought about writing to Auto Zone's corporate office to complain about the level of service and that staff is more chatty than helpful. If more people reported this nonsense to a chain store's corporate office you will see less of this behavior.

We were there to celebrate our 2 year anniversary so having a nice room was a definite must. We were able to get a 'deal' on the King Spa Room with Jacuzzi Tub. I love baths & so this was definitely a selling point. The hotel is super easy to find as you enter Cannon Beach. You pretty much exit & it is right across the street. We arrived from Woodburn Outlet Shopping just in time to catch the sunset. It was beautiful! Our check-in was pretty painless.

The exhibits are all fascinating - from his beginnings selling caramels (loved seeing the old ledgers) through the evolution of the famous chocolate bar to the various packaging and advertising over the years. The interactive exhibits are really great. Had a great time building my own chocolate production line and the stations that let you use elements from Hershey's adverting campaigns to design and email your own candy bar wrapper were fantastic.

GIx9WDPyHCEVRlu5LRdCew,7ZGG0zAaJAyymNnugTsqzA,Great for a quick bite. I had the turkey panini which came with a small salad. It was fresh and full of flavor. My friend had the lamb chops which had a sauce that lacked flavor. I think a lot more could be done to improve the dish. She also ordered the squash with duck meatballs as a side which I wasn't impressed with. The yellowtail appetizer was by far the best tasting dish of the meal. I am knocking two stars off because the waiter messed up the bill after we told him how we wanted it split and the sauces lacked taste.,3,0,4/9/2012,7ZGG0zAaJAyymNnugTsqzA,2,85,0

Your purchases help provide school clothes for refugee children in Nashville public schools!" Why haven't I popped into here before? Guilt. I am feeling massive guilt right now. The shop is in a quirky second floor location on Gallatin in East Nashville but when you walk in...it is merchandised like a proper boutique should be. Fabulous vintage finds coincide in harmony with thrifty (gently-worn) apparel and accessories. You can find interesting items for both Men and Women throughout.The prices are beyond reasonable and the brief contact that I had with the staff was sincere and helpful.

Half of our party was a fan of Chicago style deep dish" pizza and wanted to see how the food was. We ordered a large deep dish and some breadsticks. The salad bar was average (and had a large print saying it was only one trip to the bar - seemed a bit odd). Our pizza finally arrived & it was immediately declared by our group that it wasn't "Deep Dish". It was basically your Pan pizza from a standard pizza restaurant. It wasn't bad tasting but it was not "deep dish" like you would get in Chicago. Atmosphere was good and very laid back. It was self-seat and despite having a soda refill fountain - you could not refill it yourself. The staff would do it for you only.

It has a large nave that seems to go on for yards. The wooden pews are solid as the faith as the people who built this church. The church is a wonderful location for organ and vocal music.

glzOeaLhqgDzR7o6uXFrEQ,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,Took my Mom out for dinner last night - I let her choose where she wanted to go. Since moving out to Haymarket - she has been trying to explore the area - so I suggested we go somewhere she had not yet experienced. So she chose The Palate Restaurant. This is quaint little brick building sitting right on Washington Street/Route 55. It's interesting - the back side of the restaurant is connected to a building that looks like one of those old time motels where you drive right up to your room. We went in about 5:30 pm on a Sunday evening - we were the only ones there - which worried my Mother - but I encouraged her to look at this as an adventure - not to worry. We were seated by a gentleman wearing a suit - according to their web site - his name is Kevin Fitzpatrick - and he is the Partner/Fo,4,0,11/26/2007,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0

gmaImB6aae9cKDkrqJ3CGg,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,Decent place to visit. Visited here as a result of a recent Denver Tweet-up and was pleasantly surprised. As this is downtown you'll be expected to pay for parking - here it was $5 after 4 PM but that won't be available on any Rockies home game days as it doubles as a MVP parking lot. Meters run on both sides of the street until 10 PM. Inside is spacious. On premises ATM and a Chase ATM across the street. To your right is a pool table. Immediately to the front is a sectioned off table area (this is the area in which our Tweet-up was held). In this section is also a large screen TV and couch that were perfect for watching the Winter OIympics. To your left is the bar. I can vouch for the fact that the weekday female bartender (forgot her name) made me feel very welcoming and was social witho,4,2,2/27/2010,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,294,660,1

Apart from the bouncer there was no indication that a bar exists in this basement establishment. We were checking out this place after our fun time at Nurse Bettie and Happy Ending the other day. The place is just average. When we walked in there were a host of hippies dancing on the floor and almost everybody was completely wasted.The only good thing there was no cover to get in otherwise I would regretted a lot.

We came on a Sat night after a Cubs game and made reservations online (through opentable). I'm glad we did as there was a long wait (especially for all the large families/parties). We were seated right away and requested a booth as we were seated in the back and at a small table. I don't enjoy having a small table for 2 as it forces you to have to balance plates and drinks. After checking with the hostess that it was ok; we were moved to a booth right in front of the 'open' kitchen. We were able to people watch and enjoy seeing the wait staff and chefs at work. Our waitress was super nice and the food was delish. The 'bread' was pretzel rolls with two types of",4,0,9/9/2010,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,1
GpTOyO6ikCzbkjl53rU9dg,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,Yo Ho Yo Ho A Pirate's Life For Me! This is a classic Disney World attraction located in Adventureland at Magic Kingdom. I *must* ride this everytime I go to the park but I make a rule of never waiting more then 5 minutes for the ride. I usually ride during extra magic hours to avoid any type of weight. You know this ride is good when they develop a movie after it! (Let's try to block out the Haunted Mansion movie with Eddie Murphy). This dark ride has a dip which always surprises people! They expect a nice calm boat ride attraction but be prepared for a little tummy float & some pretty brutal pirates! They have women in an auction line! The scruffy dog is super cute!

They have everything from Ketchup and Mustard Squeeze Bottles to Giant Two Door Sub Zero Refrigerators. They even offer cooking classes for the aspiring Home Chef. The only reason I didn't get anything was that I came in unprepared and was a little overwhelmed by the selection and variety offered here.

I've tried both menus and loved their food both times. The Halibut is perfectly cooked - so tender and well seasoned served over creamy corn. The strip loin was perfectly cooked to medium rare and cuts were terrific. The foie gras and agnolotti were delicious starters  and the blueberry sorbet was a great dessert option to end a fabulous meals. It is one of the best places in the city to host parties.

The gingerale here is quite the popular drink and now I know why. Exquisite!

GVw_bX5CMmnO2bKcNts06g,Amc7J0F3KeAKzOOQrlpqog,The fact that this place is supposedly haunted? Sweet! It's a nice place. Very expensive. The bed and room was just ok. It was very light in there the blinds weren't very great. They have a few restaurants one which as cabana restaurant with fire pits. (AWESOME). We had the breakfast brunch which was ridiculously expensive but also ridiculously amazing all the same. I mean everything you could imagine. Their  mango habanero pepper frittas were so amazing. I just can't rave enough about their breakfast. Their views of the beach were great too. It was definitely a resort type feel. The pool was nice and heated" although it sure didn't feel that way. Check out the wine bar too if you get a chance. Their ice cream shop was pretty overrated and super pricey for what you got. Their coffee shop ",4,0,5/27/2011,Amc7J0F3KeAKzOOQrlpqog,84,365,1

I do like a few things about this place: Their bar area is spacious and has a new feeling. Lighting is darkish so be prepared to look at the menu with a flashlight (kidding but sort of). They have plenty of TV's and I happened to be there during a Devils game and the place was swarming with fans. Bruce Driver was sitting next to me the whole time and I had no idea until it was announced. They have a good selection of beers and place has a beater crowd than the one in Kenilworth. Didn't like: their food (only had their nachos with chili on the side). The chili tasted so bad...I mean like it was rancid. Plenty of chips but not a lot of cheese. Weak!

Their buffet is great (dinner) because they offer shrimp along with the other options. I usually just get the shrimp/noodles & go back for seconds.

GxKoR3GUiy-wIFa-lJYxGQ,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,So I'm not sure what it was about this year but the Tulip festival was way more epic last year with the amount of flowers they had going on at Major Hills onwards.  I'm comparing this years to last years tulip festival I guess... They had other events that were scattered around and those were ok but something seemed missing.  The kick off ceremony was in a small cramped place in between Sidedoor and Planet Coffee.  Most other times this would be an awesome place to kick off anything else but a festival?  It was very difficult to fit people in there. I've seen more things happen in the past.  It was cool that they had it across multiple sites this year.  I'm not sure if that happened in the past.

I like to order the almond croissant with a cup of joe for breakfast and order a fruit tart to bring into work for a sweet treat for later in the day. The prices are just right so it gets tempting to spend more for desserts to bring back home. Everything is nicely displayed and the employees seem to like their jobs. One thing I love is how much space they have its sooo big! The place is also very bright because the windows are so big too. They offer free internet access to give it a real french cafe vibe.

My friend enjoyed the Michigan garage rock that was playing over the speaker system. While I enjoyed my Strongbow Cider. It was nicely decorated and not run down at all.

The beds and pillows were high end and very comfortable. We loved the book lights on each side of the bed too. The bathroom had a spa like zen feel. The restaurant and staff were fantastic.  One evening we went down to the bar for a nightcap and found the ambiance very romantic and relaxing too.

This update is exactly why I do not write a place off very often. The lamb schwarma is outstanding (much better than the chicken) and the falafil is delicious. The place has expanded! They built a new seating area right next door. which increase their seating capacity by about 20-24!

This place was less expensive and much nicer than both. For the $97 a night you can't beat it. The rooms are clean and not tacky like many inns or motels and they have a nice big vanity to blow dry your hair and fix your face and everything. The beds are pretty comfy and so are the pillows. They also give you 4-5 pillows on the queen sized bed which my boyfriend liked. The staff is very friendly and efficent and whenever we needed something they were super nice and quick.

Everyone can enjoy the crazy long lazy river. Also there's a wave pool and a regular pool as well as two areas for littler kids. Tips: *VIP parking ($5) isn't really needed.

The entrees were excellent: I had the sirloin which was served over a bed of potatoes.  They made it bloody just as I requested and it was a great cut of meat which melted in my mouth.  The potatoes had a slight mustard flavor and were also good.  I also ordered the side of wood grilled broccoli which was nice and fresh and had a good wood grilled flavor.  I was able to sample my girl's BBQ pork chop which was also very good.

Most of the hallways on all six floors were scorching hot even though the a/c's were on. The first room we stayed in had a bad a/c and we had to move rooms at 5 am. For some reason they sent a security guard up to watch us while we moved. The was a little odd. And also the toilet backed up twice in 24 hours.

hBEAmlJhSTkJU4jJRAlDlg,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,I went into this store and I was very impressed with how friendly the staff was and many of them said hello to me even when I was just looking around. One even said to let her know if I needed anything which is what I expect of good customer service. I've gone to places where these people act like you're doing them a favor by asking where something is. I've never had customer service that was decent and half the time the employees in places I go to act like the customer doesnt exist. I am surprised half of them are even working. The store is clean and well stocked my only issue is that some of the aisles were congested with stuff where it was difficult to get to some things and blocking doorways to service areas in the store. Overall service was excellent and I will come here again if I am,5,0,7/30/2011,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,76,185,0

I finally received my chance where I had a little networking meet-up for some coffee with a couple of people. I would have to agree with everyone about the environment here. It is a very cozy spot to hang out. It is very quiet and relaxing and it would be easy to bring some work or just chill out after a very hectic day.

hDB7Nc2Fh-aR0JQqwvBB_Q,fPzM8rESloa6Leh0Ye7D5A,To be honest its a bit pricey for a bun mi where you can get at most Vietnamese restaurants for about 2-3 bucks you pay 5 here. It is good though the food is made to order and if you get the combo comes with fries and spicy mayo to dip with. The pop comes in a can or if you get their bubble tea you will find that it doesn't beat out Tea Garden which is down the street a bit more. Parking is metered on the street and is tough to find on school days because its located on the U of M east bank. I don't know how things are going to go down once they really start to work on the light rail construction.  The place it self is pretty small with a few tables.

Went here on a Saturday night looking for some fun eats but it was dead at 8pm. We waited to see if the table would fill up but it didn't. We started with some sushi - the fire dragon roll. It was really good and fresh. I even got my friend to try it who only eats California rolls and she was into it. The main course was OK - it wouldn't make me go back. I got the vegetable dish and it seemed like something I could make at home. They're house wine was good and the service was excellent.

I had the BLT pizza and have never had anything like it before.  Most noticeably the bacon was infused into the cheese and the lettuce and tomato was riding on top.  They asked if I wanted mayo but I refused.  Actually would have been even better like that I'm sure!

hfy8PFp_VsgOGeoHbtA8qQ,KYtrBL_Cp1CudlGC1XiiSA,It's pretty much a lower end steak house chain. The sad part is that it has the makings for a much better place and certainly the prices warrant better food and better service. The cut is not quite the best but it is cooked to order and they usually get it quite right so 1 star for that. We stopped there the first night in search of traditional fish and chips and ...whatever...its fish and chips I guess. A couple of days later on our way to our hotel we stepped in seeking shelter from the cold and decided to stay and eat - it is basically OK ... nothing fancy. expected more though but not totally disappointed.,3,4,6/11/2009,KYtrBL_Cp1CudlGC1XiiSA,174,1022,0
hFzNg_bdOgdOURwOfH9mvA,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,I've had some issues with this place primarily the staff in the fish department. I had gone there to purchase fish for my tank after not having them for a while. One of the staffers who's name won't be mentioned here had the audacity to tell me that I should wait to have so many fish in a tank. Number one he's talking to someone who's an experienced pet owner and two I already know that you don't start off with a lot of fish in a tank-that's something you tell a new fish owner. So each time I came back for something pertaining to my tanks he would stop me from buying fish until one day he did that I went to another Pet Smart store and bought the fish I wanted. It wasnt until this particular staffer didnt see me for a while then he eased up and sold me some fish. I was pretty irritated with,2,4,5/18/2009,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ,76,185,0

The interior of this building is nice. Lots of wood and old steam radiators and a nice porch (seasonal) along the front. Parking sucks but welcome to downtown. Meters are 2 hrs only and run til 10 PM during the week. The lot that is shared by the train station is $5/hr or $8 after 6 PM until 8 the next morning. Plenty of wide windows inside the 1st floor bar to people watch. Food was mediocre and I wouldn't recommend them for the food. The onion rings they rave about claim like they came from a box at Costco. The sauces were decent to scary. There was some kind of jalapeno cheese that congealed almost immediately while the spicy ranch was decent. T,3,2,2/18/2010,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,294,660,1

And now have a wine bowl (doubt that's the real name) that allows you to ice down 3 bottles and the niches in the bowl keep them upright.  It appeared in a Treme episode according to in-store press.  They also do vessel sinks...or as my MiL's plumber called them birdbath sinks.  She has one from here and loves it.   They are doing some really interesting things with pressed clay that I really like.,4,2,9/18/2010,0Igx-a1wAstiBDerGxXk2A,302,917,0

hIKlZmd38aBQknV1m2DF_Q,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,I ordered a ultimate omelet sandwich with bacon on a croissant with a medium black coffee.  This sounds pretty explanatory right? Obviously it wasn't to the 110 year old toothless brain surgeon behind the counter. The adventure is about to begin... I had to explain my order twice to him before he even went to make my sandwich.  Then when he came back he asked me again what size coffee I wanted.  For the third time I told him a medium black.   I ended up with a egg and sausage sandwich (that was still cold in the middle) and a medium coffee with cream and sugar.  Maybe I should have wrote my order out too?  Maybe I should have held a double barreled shotgun to his head.  Maybe then he would have understood.

HIpI92ZKfAL4YEHQWUvE0g,h51H-UsPhZgmPkdsjqz68g,I had a similar experience to Cindy P: I had been to the Aveda Institute a few times before and thought it was this spectacular gem because the students were all competent and I got a great haircut and style for $18. All was well with the world and my pocketbook and I sang theit praises to all friends who would listen. What can I say; one bad experience can shatter the dream. The last time (ever) that I went here I got a girl who took 3 whole hours to finish my haircut and style. I brought in a picture and asked her if my hair could look like that. It was an extremely layered cut with shorter bangs. She said yes and went to work. The whole time she talked about how she was so much better than all the other students and how she was about to graduate but should already be working in salons. ,1,11,12/6/2009,h51H-UsPhZgmPkdsjqz68g,72,379,0

After Dark is an event where the museum is open to adults only and there are alcohol and snacks made available.

hLDsFe_6rMLdNBS83gg7MQ,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,My  husband & I came here on a Friday night for dinner as I had a http://restaurant.com coupon. The prices are a bit on the high side for Korean BBQ but we went with it. Our 'chef helper' brought our food out after a while and started our grill. We had ordered Kal-bi as well as Bulgogi. We were both a little surprised when he threw all the bulgogi on and walked away. He never came back. So we were stuck trying to cook all of 'one' meat before we would have room to throw on the kal-bi. It wasn't our first time to a Korean BBQ and usually they come to make sure you are ok and not burning the meat (which can happen now and then).,3,0,11/11/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

I love the romantic" atmosphere with the dimmed lights and the cozy tables.  If I have to say something negative I do think they cram too many tables into the areas and that you sit too close to your neighbors if you're not in a booth.  Not always comfortable but it does allow more people in the establishment.

He made separate containers or each ingredient so the students couldn't complain that anyone for more. When the kids were done making the pizza they brought them into the kitchen to bake. Each pan is number I ensure students get the correct pizza. This also helped prevent any arguments. The pizza was delicious.

Most being poor but what do you really expect when you ride the subway in the heart of a big city like Chicago? It was clean the times we used it. On time. Convenient. What else can I ask for? Sure you will get the occasional classless person but that's par for the course. $2.25 price tag is avg among big cities too. No issues with this line but then again I only used it a couple of time.,3,0,9/19/2012,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,59,725,0

But I keep forgetting that they have altered their HH menu and the appeal is now gone. What used to be a list of appetizers for under $4 is now 3 items under $5. What used to be desserts & drinks on the cheap is now but $3 off or so on drinks. I should remember this each time the thought crosses my mind to go back.

They raised the double bucket of clams about a year or so ago and we've definitely cut back on that. 13 Coins has tried to re-do their happy hour but it doesn't seem to be as good of deals as other nearby places.

HSWF4_UvZyt-m2iJa-Jixg,Rs_VMM9P-4HGlFI9iArQhw,After reading previous reviews I had to see this place. After coming into Chicago for a night I went to take a tour of the rooms. It was absolutely horrible. My friend and I left to have a few drinks only then could I bring myself to say we should stay there. $55 was reasonable which left me a few hundred more to spend out for the night.  When I came in a 3:30 AM I decided to take a look at the other floors and the roof. It was worth the experience the views are amazing and if you are a fan of history this place has it. In 1936 Serial Killer Robert Nixon killed one of his victims on the fifth floor of this hotel. The over night clerk says he isn't sure which room it happened in but room 515 is creepy. Since I know the murder took place on the fifth floor that could be the spot.

hsxBhDfRr5fENyt_Y3MhGg,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,I only got a jalapeno cheddar bagel.  The highlight of the bagel was the massive machine they use to cut the bagel.  I mean they dropped a bagel in and a chute with motorized saw that cut the thing in half and shot it out the other side.  I'm sure if you tilted that machine upward you could use bagels for clay shooting! The bagel itself was weird...I'm used to Montreal style bagels and the bagel seemed like marshmallow bread to me more than a bagel.  It was light and chewy but the flavour wasn't bad at all. I would pay to be able to cut my own bagel with the machine though!  That's a gold mine waiting to be exploited Panera Bread!!!,3,2,3/9/2012,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

The salon is clean and organized and any equipment used such as a cuticle scraper and nail clippers were sanitized and sterilized and if you saw the tools lined up on a metal tray or on a clean towel they used autoclaves to sterilize their instruments.

hudMVSmxcHHSDoZWwEakSg,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,This is a spin-off of the Pat and Oscar's chain and is supposedly owned by the people who own that chain before it was sold off. Chicken has always been good here and is one of their primary specialties. The bread bites are a take of the breadsticks Pat and Oscars is known for - these are smaller muffin sized garlic rolls (much like those at Red Lobster without the cheese). Very kid and family friendly. You'll find the middle-upper classes here with their SUVs - very typical for the Torrey Highlands area. Good for an occasional visit and an interesting concept. I find the food here much better than at Pat and Oscar's. According to their website this is the only San Diego location so this must be a concept restaurant.

Nieces got the kid's grilled cheese and the non-picky one  loved it and crammed her fries on her bun to make a cheese fry sandwich." Clearly she is a genius. The picky one ate a couple of fries and the ate 1/4 of her sandwich in exchange for playing on my phone.  However the non-picky kid would not eat/drink her root beer float because the ice cream had "pepper in it." The restaurant has recently switched to New Orleans ice cream (yay!) and are using a vanilla bean ice cream which weirds out 7 year olds. E had the veggie burger which was kind of gross looking (really black bean paste w/ black beans in it?) and he said was pretty bland.  I had the",3,2,7/5/2011,0Igx-a1wAstiBDerGxXk2A,302,917,0
hvN0XrjzrrKdVVmEzb-Ujw,pRlRY5pJaTVBXrK34PN_bw,I love this place. It always have people pouring out the doors. Step inside and order at the counter and stand outside to wait for your name. The tacos are amazing and I love the salsa. The thing I always crave and want late night is the grilled corn. It is the best.  :),4,1,7/17/2012,pRlRY5pJaTVBXrK34PN_bw,1,40,0

hVQq-IAHGvHvTwV_mmDyHQ,UWT8_eEQVLsFaQfqUmX-Mw,This is a quant little shop located near the corner of Oak Park Avenue and Pleasant in Oak Park. I visited this dog shop not while spending time with some dog friendly friends. Upon entering the store I was greeted by a beautiful Long-Haired Collie who was so well behaved. I couldn't believe how calm and cheerful he/she was. My dog would have pulled every toy and treat off the shelves. I purchased a few non-preservative healthy home baked treats that my dog absolutely loved. I would continue to buy all my dog's treats there but they are closing in 5 weeks. The owner did mention that he would continue to be selling the treats online. I plan on looking into it.,5,1,3/25/2011,UWT8_eEQVLsFaQfqUmX-Mw,10,85,0
HVsxcTcir6hC_0cFvCx9dA,gCQmTheUcBwaDVTp6U5pTA,A local joint...a dive....a convenience store? The answer is D) all of the freakin above The crowd was nice...visualize the dive bar scene from Star Wars : A New Hope.   Our buxom server was adorable offering keen local insight to go with her life story.  I felt welcome at the Stage Door.  When tourists aimlessly walked in I felt the need to invite them into this wonderful world that felt more like home and less like Vegas. They have 2 slot machines.  And if you win a guy comes out from a hidden room to pay you by hand. 2 dollar Busch and Bourbon special was a pleasant surprise Check out the Stage Door when your sick of getting swindled on the main strip and just want to kick it with Elvis and his silver painted best friend.,4,0,6/1/2011,gCQmTheUcBwaDVTp6U5pTA,1,48,0

Great Bargain. 2. Fun Disposable Lingerie =)  £5 for a matching Bra and Panty set! 3. Makeup Accessories like brushes and applicators cheaper than Boots!,3,1,1/28/2011,dsu43n2DOR_pB07P1sOOZg,50,322,0
hVTPibjXBHkH01EM-TayPQ,pa5omruJjZEpBr1CzdUZ7g,A very nicely decorated restaurant that serves excellent American food. I've been there several times and always feel cozy. They have several booths along both sides of the bar. If you manage to get seated in one these you have the feeling of being the only people there. Fratello's has a large well stocked bar frequented by a group of regulars. This is just plain a good place to eat.,4,2,1/6/2011,pa5omruJjZEpBr1CzdUZ7g,27,249,0

HVXhFQv_mhQQbI-6J6R4zQ,e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,I just don't understand this place.  Why would anybody willingly go to a place where you PAY to cook your own food?  The selection isn't that great and the grills take forever.  The only saving grace is the fact that standing around the grill and chatting with your friends is fun.  I guess I just think you can do that in your own backyard.  They are wheelchair accessible and you can have someone cook your steak (for a fee).,2,2,3/6/2009,e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,96,371,0

HWcHcYRN6vIEgVdZXokQ_A,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,Dropped into Structube on Murray St to look for some furniture.  The store looks small from the outside but when you walk in it's really deep.  The furniture there is pretty modern and pretty awesome.   The store is laid out pretty nicely but it's not the largest Structube I think I've been in.   One of the sales ladies came up to me and asked what I was looking for.  After discussing what type of furniture I like and what I was looking she walked me to a few pieces to see if I liked any of them.  She was super friendly and we shared a few laughs about some of the other stores in town while I was furniture shopping. In the end I ended up getting a new sofa and tv stand!  I think they're going to look great in my place and I can't wait for them to arrive.,3,1,3/11/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0
hwCUp9WXvS5UBTvhfF-PLg,odq8SUSIT8narMOKlZrg6Q,Alex and Ani is a trendy little chain of Jewelry stores that seems to be growing as fast as Starbucks did back in the day.  They have a ton of stuff under $50 and they seem to be aiming at the under-30 market.  The store was more crowded than most of their neighbors on Congress Street and the place has an upbeat quality to it that I think will serve them well.  They're located across the street from The District restaurant and they're close to Bull Moose Music and the Friendly Toast so it looks like they picked a good spot.,4,0,8/2/2012,odq8SUSIT8narMOKlZrg6Q,432,926,0

hwlqMym9J6ANvJqKB7qkZg,Amc7J0F3KeAKzOOQrlpqog,This place was a walk from my old apartment. You could get drink til your little heart was content and walk home. PERFECT! They have an outdoor patio which is nice in the summer to talk and shoot the crap with friends. Their beer specials were pretty good during games. Their tater tots where delicious. You also get a decent amount of food for your money. My favorite shot is their skittles shot. Several mixed flavored vodkas together.,5,1,1/21/2010,Amc7J0F3KeAKzOOQrlpqog,84,365,0

So the one time I think- O greek! must be amazing. *Game show buzzer* Boy was I wrong. The meat dishes were probably a amalgamation of the same meat with different labels. Ordering a souvlaki (the core essence) of greek food....turned out to be burititos wrapped in paper. Did they microwave it?! Im so disappointed...no opa!,2,1,11/4/2011,FEzuJ7zyXkJ6sE0wkC5Siw,29,86,0

The flight we had was not special at all. I felt as though there weren't enough wait staff for the amount of customers and that was evident by the wait time. Would go back to check out some more beers though.,3,0,3/25/2011,-3s52C4zL_DHRK0ULG6qtg,106,1032,1
hwQWTQBv6AF_jL_MElgbcA,fPzM8rESloa6Leh0Ye7D5A,Target Center its nice that you allow me to travel here by taking the lightrail and not having to go through all the troubles of traffic/parking in downtown. But how I hate your seating the Excel offers much better ones. Especially the nose bleeder seats the stairs are so steep whenever I walk up them I pray that I don't suddenly trip and tumble down to broken limbs. Your concessions are spread out and jacked up pricing always makes me pass it up even though  I crave a hotdog during a Wolves game. BTW thanks for letting me in for $5 during college nights. The concerts I've seen here are just too crowded and busy to actually enjoy anything unless I shell out a ton of money to see it up close. Overall thanks for all the memories over time hopefully you get a update soon so I can build more u,3,1,2/19/2012,fPzM8rESloa6Leh0Ye7D5A,12,124,0

hX0ruz-SoQMf-KOHZ1JUCA,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,Crazee Burger was crazee good! After being disappointed with In-N-Out...I needed a burger fix (literally went her after having In-N-Out). A few blocks from our hotel and it came recommended by the staff. Their menu is quite interesting. Antelope burger? Wild Boar? Kangaroo? Who am I Andrew Zimmerman? NO thanks. They did have something normal". The bacon burger...basically ground bacon in ground beef...soooo f-ing good. Not greasy and small enough to eat in about 5 bites or at least that's what I did. We ate at the bar so the bartender was talkative and seemed genuinely interested in conversing. Maybe because it wasn't busy...who cares. So do you think I just got a burger...heck no!

My entree i had was the eggplant parmesan poboy which was 1 of the specials for the day. it was disappointing.  it came out cold and it suffered from the too much breading cant taste the main ingredient issue.  my sis. chicken parmesan came out piping hot. my sis was disappointed in her ch,3,0,1/12/2011,DejbySADs66NO3RMAuzBIw,15,103,0

HXc5hy5NXYeXYDJJatsQDQ,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhi-OxQ,Love this place! Although I wish I have seen more of the white pizza variety. It tasted absolutely delicious and the price is right. I loved the cheese pizza with canadian ham and my hubby had the white pizza. I kinda dont agree with paying an extra dollar for whole wheat dough so that's why i took one star. I feel like they are discouraging patrons from buying the wheat kind or just simply milking it. Just didnt set well with me for some reason since this is the first place I have been in that charges extra to get the wheat option ... anyways ... the pizza is most definitely fresh and made to order. This place attracts all kinds of crowds and everyone seem to be very happy. I loved the outside eating area and our server was really nice and efficient even on a busy day.

However the food wasnt very memorable - at least what i had. I had seabass which was really great. But the fish came with its head and tail which was a litle unexpected but not a deal breaker. My friend had the homemade pasta which was quite nice too.

Holy smokes you guys it's seriously OUT OF CONTROL. I am really happy I live walking distance to my fave AYCE sushi place. I've been going to this spot for 4 years or so.

hyrFpIiQo65pa8wxaTWi9Q,zBLwbe5C3hC7F5Jij4BxVQ,I think that the location is what keeps Skyway Cafe in business. Everything there is homemade but is very medicore imo.  Their selection varies often and I was most disappointed when I received an iced carmel mocha with no shot of expresso.  It seemed that the woman working behind the counter asked if I wanted an additional shot of expresso and I assumed that meant there was already one in there.  They also charged me $4.50 for this syrupy mess.  I will not consider Skyway Cafe in my go to options anymore.  Very disappointed.,2,0,8/18/2011,zBLwbe5C3hC7F5Jij4BxVQ,4,76,0

We came on a Monday night and were one of 8 people in the entire theater which was nice and private for us. The sound and layout of the room was great and I appreciate the comfy seats too. I really can't complain as everything was what you would want from a move theater experience. Tip: They sell adult beverages at the concession stand...

The white garlic pizza is a nice option. The cheese consistency is nice and melted through out. The crust is just right since I'm also not a friend of the big dough fest deep dish. Have ordered their subs a few time and they're actually quite tasty. Big fan of the club.

The meat was extremely moist and paired with delicious peppers and onions. The only thing that I think can be improved is the decor. Mostly the decor on the walls. I enjoy the comfortable booths but I think the wall decor is a little thoughtless/sloppy. Replace those ugly nautical stars with something unique and pleasing to the eye and I believe that the dining experience will be even more exceptional. I definitely want to come back and try the weekend brunch menu. I can imagine it gets hectic in that small place on the wee,4,4,1/21/2011,mGiRofzvHBp9pz0KmK9bNg,7,138,1
i4zl5gkd2zelxs0xwQABPQ,A3Rahgq3ufx81IjbEfAbGg,What's this...!? I'm actually giving the OK for a club in downtown Portland...?!! I must have the fever....the dancing fever. I like Fez for a couple reasons. 1) It has multiple levels all playing different music. You don't like the second level? Go to the third! 2.) The bartenders here are super cool and will pour ya a decent drink. 3.) 80's night...check. House/dance music...check. Each night of the week provides something for everyone. Clubs aren't for everyone...not even me most of the time. But I will say I have enjoyed myself here. $10 entry...meh. Lame. Dancing. Good. This place has changed multiple times over the years. I even accidently showed up during one of their kink" nights thinking it was 80s night. Whoops. Certainly made for an interesting time!",4,1,10/9/2012,A3Rahgq3ufx81IjbEfAbGg,14,396,0

I had Pink Cadillac-strawberry ice cream with Oreos and Funky Donkey-peanut butter ice cream with fudge and oreos-and it is hard to saw which was better! The girl who scooped my order had no problem giving me a half scoop of each so I could have both without consuming mass amounts of ice cream.

Wednsday at noon and the place was empty for the whole time we were there. I mean 6 customers total. I guess that's how they keep this place spotless. Our server was on top of us like nobody's business. We both had the salmon salad. Mine was with the caesar. It was very tasty but both of our filets were black on the top and very dry? There are tumble weeds going by this place. Does the cook have anything better to do? Everything was great and I would have given it another star.

I was seated quickly - my server - Pablo immediately visited me to take my drink order - water and coffee for me! Drinks came right out - I was ready to order as soon as I walked in - I've been lusting for more of IHOP's whole grain and nut pancakes with Blueberry compote topping. Added a side of hash browns - and some meat - a side of corned beef hash. Food came out fairly quickly - the pancakes smelled heavenly!

They did a great job with the decor took a failing rotelli's and retooled into an authentic colombian restaurant - the only thing they didnt fix was the AC - bring a sweater or ask for an outside table or you will freeze.

The sandwich and the soup weren't bad but not really great either. The interior was a wreck when I arrived.

There are also tons of slot machines for those that like to gamble. One you get to baggage claim its like a zoo especially because they put a casino right in that area. Once you found your baggage claim you will probably be waiting for a little bit because they are slow. Finding a shuttle to your hotel is a breeze because they are many options right outside the terminal. I always use a shuttle like Showtime because its cheaper and you can get a return ticket at the same time.

The burger was average at best. What time is the taste suppose to get here? The fries killed me. They looked like something that came out of your kids fuzzy pumper barber shop.

I didn't even think I liked wasabi until now. I would stay away from there. There are better places around Tulsa with cheap options.

Little did I realize how prophetic this description would be. I also ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and a glass of water. The Mushroom soup was to salty - if it had less sodium in it - it would have been a lot better. When our food came out - the steak was crispy - as in burnt.

Upon arriving they took us right in and to our table.  We had a nice table for four next to a window by the courtyard.  It's the small touches that add to the experience.  We all had dark clothes onto they went took our white linens and brought back black so the white lint wouldn't show on our clothes.  Nice touch.  The wine list is impressive with a wide selection ,5,3,10/7/2012,OiBmu84gTMZhWqDi2PXhCQ,5,88,0

The bar area is huge and has plenty of places to sit and I like the design which is wavy.

iieDQ6slacMKIkXTbDEZFQ,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,Rating VA ABC Stores is kind of weird - because they are pretty much all the same. When I stop in - it's usually to restock on single malt scotch or some quality vodka for myself - or a gift for someone.

Is it the fine detail they pay attention to uphold the best customer service or is it the way the aroma of different tongue pleasures waft in the air? Of course not- its simple! its what we make of it. We as customers have brought every establishment to its heights- well that and the queens royal visits. The bottom line is- its fabulous to see that quality of service- the genuine customer satisfaction is seen to. The food- well- the food of course was excellent and served to high perfection.

So I was taking a 10 hour a day training course around the corner from here and totally forgot my wallet one day. This totally sucked and I thought I wasn't going to be having a lunch that day until I remembered the 99 cent menu at Wendys! So I scrounged all the spare change I could find in my car and drove over to the Wendys. I actually had a decent meal with nothing more than spare change. Needless to say this kicked ass! I had an order of fries and the spicy chicken nuggets. I didn't have to buy a drink as took one of the free ones from the training center with me. They were both pretty good for fast food and best of all fit in my extremely limited lunch budget. So when you forget your wallet and ar,4,2,2/19/2010,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,58,629,0
iIwPqKeWVlIms1j6M3F7LQ,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,So many people think they go to dive bars because they found a place that serves PBR & Ganset. Those bars tend to be full of hipsters and scensters who think its cool they found" the place that is catering to them especially since the PBR's are usually $6-$8. Then are real dive bars. Places that have a sketchy vibe and you feel out of place in nice clothes and the fact you have a good career/future. If you want that time of experience than welcome to the 'nuche. I stopped in here recently for the first time since I had my fake ID back in the day although I don't think I even needed to use it when we used to go here.

They have a great swimming area with plenty of sandy beach and also grass.  Also they have bathrooms and changing areas close by.   They have fire wood that you can purchase by the sites and also a great grass area for playing sports along with a play place.  One downside is there is no where to purchase ice close by.  But Wisconsi,3,2,7/27/2011,HP0VqtQ21tcmLisoI3gY5w,10,120,0

Because they know you are going to come back anyway. I did not know that 6% of the population visits these stamp a burger o-matic's on a daily basis. It gives me a pretty good guess as to how many brain washed lemmings we have in this country. Most of the tables that I wanted to sit as were full of left-overs. All the booths were clad in a very nice fabric. But it did nothing to hide the filth. The bottoms were very colorful but they faded to dirt when you got to the top. I think the fruit flies dive bombing the ketchup dispensers were a nice touch. They should tie it in with a happy meal promotion and give the kids a venus fly trap.

IJvwhvQYXEmg3SZi5ozb3g,bAQDB1qrktXHEJcyd82Gng,COurty W. pretty much nailed it here. Very outdated restaurant (probably remodeled early 90s from the decor) with the added charm of booths held together with duct tape and springs so weak in the booths that you literally bottomed out or were bouncing up and down like a car with bad springs. A nice extra touch was the sticky vinyl table cloths and mismatched wattages in all the table fixtures. I suppose the carpet was new once but certainly has not been cleaned since it was installed. A fun game to play each visit is to see if they have fixed the neon clock on the wall. For the last two times I visited it has been stuck on (how appropriately) 4:20.

I wanted just a slice of pepperoni and a water as I wasn't trying to stuff myself. Both employees argued with me it'd be the same price as a combo and to pick a side. I really didn't want to and the cashier ended up giving me a discount. I really appreciated that as I wasn't trying to pay $8 for lunch.

Pretty tasty and fortifying considering that is a cold rainy Sunday (it's the middle of May!!). Wifey had a chicken congee.........not one of the better versions we have had.

They get an extra star for service - our waitress Meg was very friendly and dealt with our large group well. Pickles forever.,4,2,10/12/2011,n2bUMPbNNUxz0N2WkyiMjg,30,315,0

Away from all the office nonsense and over abundance of team building excercises and doing everything value added". This park is an added value to Minneapolis! It's a reasonable walking distance from work and the views are inviting. Almost too inviting with the temptation not to return to work. I enjoy catching the rays in the summer time sprawled out on on the grass or sitting on the wooden benches. Beware of the slats on the wooden benches. I dropped my key and badge in between the slats one day and spent half my lunch trying to fish it out.

IPAvJMzFxFxyooZDZ7n5Ww,fPzM8rESloa6Leh0Ye7D5A,The only reason why we went here was because after a 4hour road trip from CA we wanted some dim sum to start our weekend off and since the Harbor Palace was listed off offering it on the Malls board we walked over and decided to give it a try. There wasn't much variety after looking at 4-5 different carts that's all they had to offer. The siu mei and the chicken feet were the highlights everything else was bland and not exactly worth the meal . Go save your stomache for one of the places to eat at in the malls or try out ping pang pong down the road for better dim sum. Though for some reason the place was filling up pretty quick i'm assuming is because of that sign thats posted listing off all of the restuarants and what they have to serve.

The sad thing is that people are extremely careless driving in the parking lot and it's usually some loud and obnoxious hood in a raggedy car tearing through there like it's the Indianapolis 500 with an army of brats with no home training. I am stunned when their approach is piss poor because of the fact that they act like they're too good to be there....if that's the case then go to college get a degree and move into another line of work.

The bartender was funny and added to the laid back ambiance when you cozy up to the bar. Quirky knick knacks sat on the bar top for customers to curiously paw through while placing their drink orders. I bonded with the hot pink Jesus statue that doubled as an 8 ball. A band was wrapping up as we moseyed in but we were able to grasp the vibe when we ordered wine. This place is about as casual as you can get besides hosting friends at your own abode.

IwRE2mFZduD39SgYrXynRQ,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,I stopped in this place with a buddy. It's a new place and with a bagel place down the rd to boot. Their bagels aren't really my style but they were good. I like big and puffy ones. These were smaller. Their taylor ham is the good stuff and not that crap generic ones you sometimes get. What won me over was the overly friendly staff. Huge smile on all the staffs face. They are quick to please. Their prices aren't too bad and there is ample parking outside. Bonus is they have plenty of seating inside as well. Worth a stop in if you are on the highway or nearby and want a quick bagel fix. Enjoy!,3,4,9/11/2012,8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw,59,725,0

ix3QBpmRTwlGkWPYW4VVjw,gCQmTheUcBwaDVTp6U5pTA,It's early in the game for this establishment.  And of course there are some kinks to work out.  But things look promising. The Look-I loved the aged brick interior.  The bar view is really neat giving the patron a direct view into the brewery.  Maybe the diamond plate wasn't the best idea or maybe I'm just being catty. The Food-There ain't no kitchen.....but they had pretzels and a sandwich stand that served brats and Italian beef.  I have a feeling this will get tweaked some.  All items were sampled and all were serviceable. The Service-Our waitress was nice enough but she clearly was over whelmed.  I imagine this will get better. The Beer-Only 1 Triton original tap was ready to be served:The Field house Wheat.  It was a bit too sweet for my liking.  The honey flavor was overbearing but ,3,2,9/17/2011,gCQmTheUcBwaDVTp6U5pTA,1,48,0

I guess the first floor is for the regular audience. Second one is reserved for private parties. Yelp elites and the +1 ones were whisked to the third floor for the party. Initially it got little cramped when everybody was waiting to get a drink at the bar. But the sexy bartender started taking care of the poeple standing in line. She was really attentive and made sure that everybody had drinks in their hands.

Some of the other pies looked outstanding though and the excellent service will bring me back again. The next time I will make a different selection!,3,6,3/16/2008,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

iZz-j87L9_yrRItEwAOLiA,HP0VqtQ21tcmLisoI3gY5w,When I first walked into this place I was a bit disappointed.  The place doesn't have anything special/appealing for the eyes.  Also when I went to order at the counter the glass food display looked bare. There were a couple plates with a few pastries and cupcakes on it but there were so few that I wondered how long they had been there. Well I ventured to find out. :) It was hard to decide what I wanted because they have a great coffee selection. Also they have a smoothie section with natural boosts you can put in them. I really like it because it reminded me of Jamba Juice but more localized.  I decided to go with the carmel latte and it was DELICIOUS! Just the right amount of Carmel.  Also I sat down right away and the barista brought me my drink which was pleasantly surprising. I ended ,3,2,12/29/2011,HP0VqtQ21tcmLisoI3gY5w,10,120,0

I recently purchased a Movado watch as a gift.  I was informed that I can bring it back whenever and have it re-sized when appropriate.  So my wife and I came back over the weekend and had the supervisor on duty (she later identified herself as this) determine how many links she would need to remove and she said it would be finished within 30 minutes.  I thought this was odd considering I've seen what needs to be done to re-size a watch and I don't ,1,2,12/20/2010,YomNW639BgIcOMwuS9LHcg,2,25,0

j4lhioExkfQpq2gRjQoUZA,qmjoMFMZdLH69_6eGTGDZw,This is a wonderful hotel.  It was extremely clean and the staff were terrific.  It has a nice pool and the breakfast bar had sausage biscuits on it.  I would definietly stay here again.  I am actually looking forward to staying there again.,5,1,8/11/2009,qmjoMFMZdLH69_6eGTGDZw,48,155,0
j4toTbAzv-7hJ7obcp-kVQ,pSM4YXjSLdje8gX-tLLccA,Pet hotel is a joke and grooming is over priced with all the rules. But I come here for the dog food and treats and the bones. I have a perks cards that occasionally gives me really great deals.,3,2,7/10/2010,pSM4YXjSLdje8gX-tLLccA,154,333,0
j4yRy_zFDPAtQZ83i4alYA,-3s52C4zL_DHRK0ULG6qtg,Great location right on the corner! Multiple options of bikes to rent and the people there are each pretty easy to approach. Not the most organized place but a fun experience.,4,1,8/8/2010,-3s52C4zL_DHRK0ULG6qtg,106,1032,0
J5bV8tFBL4MSnNpRoMoKsg,WgaycWkFXshvGtct42d_-w,Tried this place for the first time with my BFF for her B-day Brunch. And seriously it was the best eggs bennedict I have ever had in my life (and I drink hollandaise sauce...well not really but you get the idea). I had the East Coast Benny which consisted of the usual poached eggs on an english muffin topped with hollandaise but low and behold CARAMALIZED ONIONS AND FRESH LOBSTER MEAT. *insert heavenly aaaaahhhhhh sound here* Seriously if it wasn't $14 and I hadn't ordered a $13 mimosa I might have ordered myself an extra entree because it was that good. In fact I am salviating like Pavlov's best friend here just thinking about it. BEST BENNY EVER.,5,1,7/28/2011,WgaycWkFXshvGtct42d_-w,7,106,0

j5jea9XNPTq1Mztb78e3gQ,hb6AOwkVyvtu8bPu7TFAaw,Stopped for a wash and carpet cleaning while in town.  Did a great job although they had to re-vacuum the interior since they removed the mats after the initial vacuuming.  Great place for a wash.,4,0,7/29/2012,hb6AOwkVyvtu8bPu7TFAaw,2,41,1
j5RX8FPQ3mvn7BecB3uYtg,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,Thank you for you convenient location. My stupid ass failed to relieve myself before starting off on my drive to northwest Indiana.

j5sSb2Zv9Ww5PeEH8wA5Jg,SQQmVal-sMynLmVI7_pUbA,I absolutely hated this place.  The dumplings" were disgusting.  The duck dish was so over-cooked that before we even tasted it we knew it was well-done to the point of being brown and as hard as a hockey puck! The tastes were not true to Thai food at all.  I've moved here from San Francisco and know what real Asain food should taste like.  This wasn't even a good immitation it was horrific.  I'll never go here again and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!!!  The spice came from chili powder... let's go back to lesson 101 in Thai cooking people!!! Come on now Buffalo we need some good Thai food!!!",1,2,2/8/2009,SQQmVal-sMynLmVI7_pUbA,3,27,0
j5tsUKsvG7OKt9_mGXKwMw,XCJ7J2i0vpjQcpKbA1vpiA,We went there twice while staying in Vancouver.  Each time the service was quick and efficient.  The wait staff were very nice.  The crepes were tasty and we loved the crisp fries.  We'd definitely go again!,4,0,6/6/2012,XCJ7J2i0vpjQcpKbA1vpiA,0,11,1
J5Y_MxrNrmbCqd6bosncmA,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,I am surprised by all the bad reviews. After failing to figure out an authentic Korean place nearby to grab a quick bite we decided to munch on the regular BK sandwiches. We walked in post 3 in the morning and the place had some customers. The guy behind the counter was quick.My sandwich came out fresh and fast and that's what matters in the wee hours of the morning!!,3,2,4/17/2012,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,29,559,0
J5ZU5w9e0YbAenD-51_q_w,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,I have been on a summer bowling league here for the past two summers and it is a pretty fun place.  This place is huge.  They do have a really nice beer garden with outdoor sand volleyball courts where they have summer leagues too.  The bartenders are really friendly and fun and they have karaoke here too at the indoor bar.  The actual bowling alley has much to be desired as it looks like everything here is the original from when the place was constructed back in the 80's.  A remodeling job is needed to keep pace with all of the modern Brunswick zones that are taking over as of late.  The food here is not really that good at all.  I only eat here when I am really hungry and I need to get something in my stomach before I start drinking.  They usually have some pretty good open bowling speci,3,1,3/16/2006,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0
j5ZUyTJfr0p5EJC4kCzbUg,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,This place is a little Irish Pub and most of the clientele are Irish.  This is a good place to go during the week for an after work drink when the place is not that crowded.  it is not all that big and on the weekends it fills up to the point of being uncomfortable.  I really can't say that this is a very fun crowd though.  Everyone is pretty much in their little cliques of who they came up their with.  The pace gets very warm and extra smoky inside than most places.  I avoid this place on the weekends or on weeknights when they are hosting their steel-tip dart league.,3,1,3/22/2006,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

j6s1Q9BcCMmMeogK1hNwUQ,XDpH_eZVnKoKyVE1bxotSA,Great breakfast burritos! Pete's is one of the best places for breakfast in Denver. It's a smallish 50's style diner and a great place to people watch.,5,2,5/19/2006,XDpH_eZVnKoKyVE1bxotSA,78,155,1

J7404nInHUg5ddtoogLmAw,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,Was glad to have visited the Italian Fiesta on Taylor Street.It was fun filled event.There were two stage performances going on simultaneuly at two ends of the sreet.One was the rock and other was the traditional music with Italian touch.Everbody was enjoying the music.The band was really playing some nice music.It would have been much better if there was more seating capacity and a small area where people could dance. There was plenty of food to be tried.Had a Parmesan chicken sandwich and it was good.A number a stalls were selling different kinds of merchandise. It's always good to attend well oraganised street festivals like Italian Fiesta on Taylor Street.,5,2,8/11/2010,USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,29,559,0

J7gwR0B2dErR5qMbCTHSLg,1URt0ckoK9aA5lw1fJSf5Q,Our Dance Floor Was Full ALL Night!!! Gil did a phenomenal job at our wedding and we can't say enough good things about DJ Chicago!!! Mark & Gil were such a pleasure to work with from start to finish. They did an absolutely fabulous job coordinating with us prior to the wedding and with the music the night of - our dance floor was packed the entire event & everyone had an amazing time [our crowd was about 50 % younger/older - so no easy task]! Gil made sure to play music we requested - checked in with us throughout the night - and catered to the crowd to keep the party going all night. I would absolutely refer anyone to DJ Chicago in the future!!,5,0,5/3/2012,1URt0ckoK9aA5lw1fJSf5Q,0,4,1
j7llBN8ZWIIekKEba6iujQ,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,Feeling the need to use some of massive stash of Hilton hotel points I booked a room here on a Friday night. It is of course in a great location with tons of great places within walking distance. The upsides are the hotel has large rooms with great views on the HHonors floor at least. The quality of the room was top notch other than the bathroom which was both small and older than the rest of the room. The rooms were also very quiet considering you were in a busy hotel in downtown Boston. The downsides are slow elevators and crazy expensive parking even for Boston standards.,4,2,4/4/2012,wB8ATiDKotKsP-jEPJgwtw,58,629,0
j7p8T6FgFPZKEDwu0EQHeQ,4ssDCBvb9LC2cMpWxjhpRQ,I have had two root canals with Dr. Diaz Albertini.  I must say that while it wasn't like sittin on a beach drinking a Corona - it wasn't bad - at all.  He is an extremely talented endodontist and I would highly recommend him if you require a root canal. He is a part of the McCormick group located on College Drive in Palos Heights.  They are not the cheapest endodontists that you will find - but I think that they are some of the best that I have visited.  Sad to say that I have had 8 or so root canals - so I have become sort of an expert on the process.,5,2,9/26/2011,4ssDCBvb9LC2cMpWxjhpRQ,26,185,0
j7t6sET-qhufS5bkG49wTw,R9Sg7UkLOTle_7lyXXOTEw,I eat here all the time.  They have a special on Groupon Now for this place so check that out.  The specials are great.  $5 for a medium one topping pick up special and $8 for a extra large.  Theyre open 24/7 so its very convienent.  Make sure you get their menu once you get there because they have awesome deals on there.,5,0,7/19/2012,R9Sg7UkLOTle_7lyXXOTEw,6,45,0
J7XwglwcrhShF47LHu_Ipg,zHvS1F_6wOPSLUk6vpDEGA,I went to RJ Grunts for the first time because I had a major craving for a burger! The wait was 30 minutes at 8pm on a Sat. When we were finally seated we had the smallest table ever squished up against a wall. We were next to an 8 year old birthday party which was quite noisy. Then we were surrounded by people eating from the salad bar... which looked pretty blah to me... and overpriced. That's all fine and dandy but every time people walked past me the slammed into me or my chair which got really annoying really fast. The food took a while to come out and we only saw our waitress when we ordered and when we got our food. I think she hid in the kitchen most of the time. The burgers were good. Thick and juicy but at the same time greasy and difficult to eat when the bun got soggy. The grea,2,0,8/29/2010,zHvS1F_6wOPSLUk6vpDEGA,35,502,1

J8b_OCiASacaCTVkubXYLA,TxkL_XV9EwygBIXiuW6kvQ,This place was great and completely thought out from parking until you return from the tour.  The shuttle takes you from the parking lot to the brewery but first you get a little city tour which is fantastic.   Once at the brewery you begin your self guided tour.  Everything about this place was great including the free beer after the tour.   Read more about my tour here at my blog:                   http://talesofatraveler.…,5,0,9/17/2012,TxkL_XV9EwygBIXiuW6kvQ,2,195,0
j8earQ1CWHn5TY6B5KcENw,NkVtKQ4wPSuv5OjJTq2nJw,This practice is the most caring practice I have ever visited....from the receptionist....dental hygienist ...and most of all Dr. Gibbons. Dr. Gibbons has even come in on his day off due to my hectic schedule! When was the last time you heard of a doctor doing that?

j8K0Wfmtnl1QF_tibMfUtA,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I came to see Dr. Petersen. My last dentist I had been going to for years but I was never really satisfied with his staff and office location (smack dab downtown Seattle). I was happy to find this was only a short distance from my house as well as having a friendly staff. The cleaning and x-rays went fairly quickly and Dr. Petersen was really friendly and personable. They do have multiple doctors in this location as well.,4,0,9/18/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

j8q0I9VMfoE8khZ9hSfTYw,TxkL_XV9EwygBIXiuW6kvQ,This is a great little place to grab breakfast in terminal 7 (United).  There is food to go or a sit down area where they take your order.  I didn't realize there were two different areas and when I got up to the register I asked if I could just get bacon and eggs even though it wasn't on the menu.  They said yes.  I found at many places at LAX offer other things that aren't on the menu so if you want something just ask for it.  They were more than happy to help me.

I had to actually plug in behind the toaster! Anyway...........this is a grocery store not an office. Enjoyed a cappuccino and then later ordered a fresh Vietnamese type soup (pho like). pretty good if not authentic broth.

j8T9oglJAFmxnQKGWvZ1dg,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,This place does a great carry out business. So much so that they shouldn't have seats. It felt like I was sitting in a cafeteria. Very uncomfortable atmosphere. We were going to leave but I was hungry. It was very busy and the waitress really didn't have any time to be serving tables. Everyone one around us got tea and drinks because she took the time to ask them. I guess I didn't look thursty? The service was crappy. Two people walked in 10 minutes apart and ordered a huge sacks full of food at the counter and there order was ready before ours? The food was really good though. I had the orange peel beef and a cup of wonton soup. The beef really wasn't spicy at all. My friend had the Hot and sour soup and the beef low mein. He said it was a little greasy? I would also skip the egg rolls. B,3,1,11/10/2007,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,356,927,0
j8zGSCSOVIYKpGgghBFu0Q,NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,I swear I was just here a few weeks ago and now they're closed.  Oh well. I thought it was funny that they had a big sign on the door stating that they didn't accept coupons anymore.  Maybe that should have been some sort of indication that they weren't going to be around much longer. Oh well. I guess I'll stick to Publix for my sub needs.,3,1,Update - 8/18/2009,NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,270,932,0
j997355U4WWKjiHlunNrXQ,bXmJD9Xcr8H1wgIkjC1Blw,We had great service and an attentive waitress.  Unfortunately this restaurant closed a week after we dined here so a full review is wasted. This is a chain and the food we had was nothing special and wasn't worth the price we paid.  It might be why they went out of business at this location.,3,1,6/13/2010,bXmJD9Xcr8H1wgIkjC1Blw,119,320,0

j9pHIrd5KQzMeqnIfI4nNA,mGiRofzvHBp9pz0KmK9bNg,When I want cheap Chinese take-out THIS is the place I go. My favorite dish is the Sesame Chicken with steamed rice. I usually go with some crab rangoon and/or an egg roll. What bugs me about a lot of Chinese chicken dishes is that a lot of the pieces end up being slimy once you bite into them. I usually never have that problem at Happy Dragon and each piece is nice white chicken breast.,4,2,1/7/2011,mGiRofzvHBp9pz0KmK9bNg,7,138,0
j9QH96hWEMgQknWuuaxMpg,w9TB3lYUutVaVPc7RXhSmg,Probably the best spot in Bedford.... It is a cute little set up next to the train track....warm and charming ambiance with the full train station theme.  The food was good - I had the veggie burger and a side salad.  My friends had the grilled chicken salad - which was a plump fresh chicken breast - not frozen or strips that you'll find at an Applebee's type of place.  All in all - quite good.  I'd go back if in Bedford again....,3,0,1/23/2012,w9TB3lYUutVaVPc7RXhSmg,2,137,0

Ja4tw4oMj-S-Hjo8NPlBog,WKpzoB_oom4OSEe703-uxw,Ate lunch with friends after a visit to MOCA--of which Cafe Nola is located.  Spinach and tuna was by far the best thing at the table.  The lobster mac & cheese was rich and filling after two bites. I recommend just about everything at Cafe Nola and could eat anything on the menu.  It got four stars because the service of our particular waiter was less than stellar.,4,0,5/24/2011,WKpzoB_oom4OSEe703-uxw,29,142,0

She is a perfectionist and gives you a great shape. She consults you to make sure you are happy. Lee cuts my hair and it always comes out great! Cons: Jun will call you if you are two minutes late but you can pretty much expect to wait every time you show up for an appointment.

The shop extends a long way back and you can find an astonishing variety of goods in there. I've picked up everything from an umbrella to Tylenol to nail clippers. Not sure whether it's expensive for the USA but not too bad when converted to British pounds. One thing to warn you is that the security guard checks the bags of all customers as you leave the exit to Penn station - it's not because you look like a shoplifter!,4,4,6/23/2009,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,754,1693,0

I had been here a few times over the years and it's a spot that I hit up only if I do not feel like driving a lot and want something between mellow and minimalistic rowdy. The bar: The bar is average and the drinks are watered down. The only thing that I can say I love is the outdoor seating which is lovely in the summer time. The dancefloor/dj: The music is top 40. I do wish they did switch up sometimes and it makes me want to "evacuate the dance floor". The dance floor is relatively small and full of guys just staring at women and wishing they had grown a pair and could actually go dance with a few of the cougars.

The cottage itself is brought to life by the informative tour about Wordsworth and his family. There are written and audio guides for more information about the exhibits in the museum and art gallery There is also an interesting family graveyard next to the cottage with some wonderful poetry on some of the headstones.

I've never understood why HD continues to lay out their store in a way that forces you to park near the entrance or near the exit but never 'between'. The key department is where I've been most in this store although recently a bathroom shower curtain rod broke and the 'clerk' pointed us to the back of the store to the completely wrong section. I believe she sent us to curtain rods instead. We eventually found our way to the right department and then were on our merry way.

jeQSxc0wfFAQsb1VYhnCxw,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,This was the first time I've tried the Haymarket location of Angelic Nails - I've been going to the Centreville location for about 3 years now. I was out around Haymarket looking around as I am in the process of house hunting and I realized I needed to get a manicure/pedicure. So I stopped in for a session. The girl who performed my 'cures was good enough - I'm so used to the folks at the Centreville location that it was sort of weird going somewhere else - I kind of felt like I was betraying them! :-) The place was pretty busy - there was a steady stream of customers coming in. I was the only male in there during my visit. Total was $37 and I tipped the girl $8.00.,3,2,12/16/2007,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0
JesGWMJ_SdTS_QQvbAhwXg,YEJLX5Al2N03i8lix-iXXQ,This was my first time running the Hot Chocolate 15k and felt it was a great race. Packet pickup was smooth.  In and out.  Appreciated how early they opened on Thursday because I got in before all the masses.  Two full days of expo/pickup is needed for a race this size and they hit the mark on that.  Glad it was at Union Station because I had to drive in from Indiana and it was easy to find. Considering how many people run this (almost the same amount as the Chicago Marathon) it was pretty well organized. I was really surprised at the large amounts of port-o-potties!  Good job!  I didn't ever have to wait to pee!  Big deal to me at races.  More than enough! Gear check was easy to find.  Wish the weather cooperated better the days leading up to the race day though because the park was prett,4,2,11/18/2011,YEJLX5Al2N03i8lix-iXXQ,24,147,0

The staff were nice and didn't kick us out right away as they started to close down. I hate when they are crabby about getting customers out the door.

Dr. Meyers was very open and friendly and one who really loved what he did. He's very engaging and talks to the patients and my boyfriend was very comfortable with him and was very happy with the visit with this doctor. He expressed an interest in making him his primary doctor since he seems to be more concerned about his patients needs and makes sure that they're ok and keeps their spirits up when they're going home. It was at that moment that I saw my boyfriend's attitude change very fast because he was more happy and upbeat about going home after his primary care doctor had him parked up in the hospital for what I saw was an uneccesary number of days that left him weak and lethargic.

JG73PBPKaQ3UkAAxKBWQrw,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,We met some friends at the Cherry House Cafe this past Sunday for brunch. I was able to call ahead and reserve a spot for 9 people about an hour or so before the time we wanted so that was a plus. The service was just ok. The waiters barely were present and were not that great at their job. I ordered one of the breakfast combos that came with eggs and biscuits and gravy. The eggs were really over down and unbearable to eat. The biscuits and gravy were delicious though. That is the reason this place got three stars from me.

It is nearly impossible to miss.  I have patronized the Boulder City Burger King when I wanted to eat something light and quench my thirst after hiking in the vicinity. Usually onion rings and cola.

The only downside is that the bartender has to serve both sides of the bar so they are constantly moving and were always available when I wanted them. The drink menu was interesting and the selections were well made. The beer selection however did not match up with the drink or wine selections. So don't go here expecting a wide selection of beers. The food menu was not the most creative menu especially at the price point they were charging. That said the things I had were very good. I especially liked the blue cheese risotto croquettes.

I was so looking forward to a sandwich loaded with meat. Instead I received a sandwich with an adequate amount of meat and some grill marks. I opted for no thousand island. It came with a fair amount of sauerkraut and pickle slices which made the sandwich a little better. My pickle spear tasted oddly like baked beans. The cucumber salad was pretty good. It was very refreshing and tasty. The cilantro really added flavor. Liked the online ordering feature. The rest of the sandwiches on the menu look tasty. I hope so. More than the reubenator was.

I also like the carnitas tortas with the hot salsa and the sopas are also nice. The fish tacos are good but they lack flavor and arroz y frijoles is more on the dry side.

That said you drop it in Tribeca and it becomes one of my favorite hotels in NYC especially for the price. It also one of the best hotel staff's I've ever encountered. They went way out of their way to helpful and took care of anything you could possibly need. You can not beat the location as its easy to get to from almost anywhere in the city with multiple subway lines right out in front. The rooms are well appointed and very large for NYC standards.

JPWmnG6c9I2h1Jt8OYxf2g,zHvS1F_6wOPSLUk6vpDEGA,I was surprised by how many reviews Pumpkin Moon has on here already.  I used to come here all the time just to peruse all the goodies.  They have a ton of nostalgic toys and memorabilia in this store.  Everyone is always super friendly and willing to help you find the perfect gift.  They also have more current toys and memorabilia" (I put that in quotes because I do not know what to call items from current TV shows and movies).  I got my sister some Family Guy themed items here and I bought a girlfriend a cigarette extender... yes it is a very eclectic shop.  I try to stop by every time I am in the Oak Park area... I just wish they had better prices... but I guess I don't mind paying a little more if I know it is not going to a corporation!",4,1,12/25/2011,zHvS1F_6wOPSLUk6vpDEGA,35,502,0

Boy was I ever wrong.  The butter chicken dish was watery and not creamy.  Lacked flavour and was warm.  I don't think I'd ever come back here and it's made me think twice about heading to the non express version of this restaurant.  Save yourself the money and skip this place unless you're REALLY hard up for Indian food and don't want to walk a block and a half.,2,1,5/25/2012,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0

JqR80hequjfDzqp0DowcHA,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,I do like Hallmark cards and love the Hallmark shops in the USA. We don't have them in the UK though you can find their cards in other shops. I also like the fact that the Hallmark shops are owned by different people/franchises and they name the shops. The range of cards in the USA is much wider and more creative - I've noticed a trend towards musical cards in the last few years. I also like the wider range of religious cards in the USA. Hallmark also carry nice gifts and I've picked up quite a few presents for friends over the years. Their Christmas tree ornaments are cute,4,12,11/5/2009,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,754,1693,0

Tram's is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place! It was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him. I ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as Pho Hanoi") with garden rolls and a glass of water. I suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern ",4,3,6/20/2009,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0

Recently moving into the area I wanted to find a place to eat near my home and The Savage Depot is less than 5min off so I decided to give them a try. Its a old train depot with lots of history and I like the fact that they kept that for the building. When first walking in there was two workers who both greeted us there was no one in the place so she said seat yourselves and gave us some menus. I ordered a turkey wrap which was bland but the waitress later mentioned that the owner was planning to take the wraps off the menu since they are always updating the food. My brother ordered a pizza.

Chef Vola's is located in the basement of what appears to be a residence just off the boardwalk. The food is absolutely outstanding and is prepared pretty much the way you want. There is a menu but the waiter gives a long list of specials and basically tells you that you can create your own meal. Everything is delivered to your table quickly and exactly the right way. The space is quite small and the tables are a bit cramped but that's part of the charm. The staff is very friendly and efficient. An owner is there to greet you and to check on how your meal was.

The following review is based on my most recent visit alas most disappointing visit here. I like the food at Chipotle. it is not the most authentic but it is tastier than most other fast food options available. This place is ALWAYS packed during the lunch hour and it can be very difficult to eat in. We arrived here at about 1:15 hoping that most of the big lunch crowd would have already dispersed.  It was still packed but they were moving the line quickly. Lara went and got the one remaining table for us and i went ahead to place our orders.

JTdBKlX2D12g7qdHhQVNDw,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,The view alone is worth 5 stars. It was a tiring drive to Hana and this little gem was at the end. Serene is the only way to describe it. I didn't say a word as we sat waiting for our food. I just staired at the ocean crashing on the rocks. I know I should have eaten more fish as we were surrounded by water. But they have wild pigs everywhere so the pork should be good as well. The bbq pork sandwich was good. Very tasty with the home made bbq sauce. My buddy had the catch of the day sandwich and he said it was delicious. So there you have it. I went to Maui and ate pork the whole trip.,4,3,9/11/2012,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,356,927,0
jtFpcx_P0PqfnpNXLHriuw,qmjoMFMZdLH69_6eGTGDZw,Went on Saturday at 2:00 and the place was packed!  So much going on.  I tried the pork wings from the American Legion and they were awesome.  A new favorite!  The ham and beans were good as well.  My daughter tried the ham sandwich & corn on the cobb.  She loved both of them.  The ham sandwich is just ham on some homemade bread but as simple as it is my daughter loved it.  I think it was the homemade bread that was so awesome. I bought some soy candles and discounted Avon but we were mainly there for the food and we were not disappointed.  Great food and a beautiful day! They really try to discourage people from bringing their dogs so please be mindful of that.  They can't enforce it but for sanitary purposes it's best to leave Fido at home.,5,1,Update - 10/1/2012,qmjoMFMZdLH69_6eGTGDZw,48,155,0

The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.  There is even a small mount to connect just about anything from camcorder to DVD player to ipod to the TV system so you can watch your own stuff on their TV.  Internet is free!  The snack in the lobby are well priced.  Shuttle to airport and surrounding area.

I didn't realize it was below Far Niente and took a while to put it all together. They have an after work $4.44 martini and tapas special which is slightly misleading because the food isn't on the special only the select 6 martinis are. The food is 3 small bites for $25 or 5 small bites for $40. I've had the bison burger - dry; the Y" burgers have a kick to them - prefer them over the bison; the pizza - its good but nothing spectacular. the food wasn't memorable by any means but centrally located and reasonably priced make it a place to return.",3,0,8/22/2012,ZzA0SBWKSRJA8y5tlszrjQ,2,65,0

The service here was good it did not wow me or knock me off my feet but they did a good job at keeping up with us rowdy group of Yelp-folk.

JWO4LoG4a2lanxYQbLIYsg,UdmnmlRKY8-YRl-DFBql8Q,Its a great location for a hotel- right off Michigan Ave. And it was incredibly cheap. I booked through Hotwire and it turned out to be about $70 a night including tax and fees.The rooms are small but nice. Wifi is free and worked great for me. I had no problems with the staff- everyone was friendly and polite. The one thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that my room was freezing! I was on the top floor which probably contributed to the cold. I punched the thermostat up to 80 degrees but the room itself never got anywhere near that warm.,4,0,12/13/2010,UdmnmlRKY8-YRl-DFBql8Q,0,2,1

It turns my blood cold with shock first then hot with anger.  How can anyone 10 years after 9/11 not know about the airport security protocol?! Eek!   It's been like this for far too long and why doesn't the airport do something about it?  How can the administration put with this embarrassing inefficiency? It would be nice if  we could use Global Entry for security into the airport too. (Dreaming) I'll bring something to do in the lines in the meantime like my iPhone so I can review on Yelp!

I feel as if I ordered the wrong thing and that everyone at my table had a better experience than I did. I went with the egg and cheese sandwich with bacon and a side salad. (I can't quite remember what the ACTUAL name of the sandwich was--my apologies.) What bothered me (and this is just a taste preference that wasn't noted on the menu) is that the side salad was overrun with a strong fennel taste. The bread on the sandwich also had fennel seeds in it so the dish had a strong anise flavor. I am not a fan of fennel. I did however really enjoy that the egg was poached on the inside so I could enjoy some yolk-y messy goodness.

I used to live near the Federal Way location and so I was a bit sad to move into Seattle and lose my savings! This location is new and so everything is a little 'fancier' than the other stores.

It may also not be as busy since now there are so many locations. Some co-workers of mine teased me for shopping here saying the food is expired or old but I have never had that issue.

The rationale they used was that my few batteries would not effect the environment.  I responded that might be fine if I were the only one in the world throwing out my batteries - but that is clearly not the case.

I know they are famous of the chicken and waffles but I did not get that because it does not seem appetizing to me. I did try some and I thought the waffles were great but the chicken not so much. I got the BBBLT and a side of fries. The portions are huge and had I known that I would have probably split it with someone even though I did finish the whole sandwich. My biggest complaint of the whole experience was that my food took forever to come out especially after everyone in my party was already served.

Being onion-averse I rarely reach for samosas but the ones doled out here are the NUTS. Quite spicy and a large serving ($3.99) that was difficult to share because they were so tasty.

K3CCgc5tzxCoSbVBhstcag,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,My salsa friend Hilary and I came here to try Miguel & Mayana's salsa class here on a Monday evening. The pub is located round the back of the Wimbledon town centre one way system. It was quiet in the large bar area and the salsa class took place upstairs on the wooden dance floor. It was an interesting class as I was distracted  by the huge TV screens showing live football! The other odd feature was a mechanical bull in the corner Drinks were on the cheaper side and they were happy to give us water after the class.,4,13,1/19/2012,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,754,1693,0

Ted's was the closest to the hotel but they were closing (??!!) at 10:30pm. Nothing like downtown Atlanta night life. Had noticed Sidebar from earlier in the day. I little shady on the walk over and back...but there was safety in numbers. Did not have opportunity to sample any food. Beer choices were moderate.

I stay at hotels pretty regularly in New Orleans (which is known for having wonderful boutique hotels and B&B's) and the Fairfax tops them all. Cheryl always is friendly and courteous every time I come there! There are only SIX rooms in this plantation house built in 1852 but they are six magically captivating rooms! Rates are reasonable and of course come with breakfast (and free wifi). I usually can get the Fairfax or Murphy Suite for $169/ngt. The other four rooms are very comfortable as well. There is also a bar area with tables and chairs next to the lobby. The city of Franklin is a very peaceful and charming town with lots of character.

This was one of my first hangouts in SD and I still go here with friends to play darts on occasion.  It just doesn't feel the same since the  management changed a year or so ago but everything must change.

K73OkvbpZFZnLR8RbdyrGQ,qExR8NN0q7PZBQpNOL_VZw,California burger caught my eye because of the avocados. I can't say no to that tasty green fruit. This burger was ginormous! It also came with bacon which the pieces were jutting out all over the place. I asked for it without mayo but it was slathered on anyway. Sigh. I'm thinking the kitchen may not pay too much attention to special requests because the jalapenos were also missing from my friend's burger. My meat (heh) tasted pretty good but was a bit under seasoned. The avocados that topped it were already mashed a bit which probably saved the bun. They don't always hold up to avocado slices. I had to rub my bun around to distribute the green mash but it was pretty tasty. The fries and tater tots were both just typical and nothing special.

Decided to give this a try because a) I had never been to this location and b) the last time I ate at one of these was probably back in 2005 or so. Food was abysmal. Paid $7.99 for a burger that I could have spent a buck or two more at Fuddruckers and got a better quality and larger burger. Pie was OK. Pie was offered because the server messed up the burger order. Props to the server for coming over on his own accord and fessing up to the mistake and offering the pie as a comp. Drinks were promptly refilled. MCs is now doing the Olive Garden thing where bottles of wine are placed on the table. Who thinks to drink wine at a MC's? Isn't the primary clientele old folks?

It was briskly busy but not too loud or cramped. This place is huge though and very nicely and tastefully decorated. We started out with the calamari appetizer which was was lightly battered in a tasty sauce that had just a hint of spiciness but it didn't;t overpower the mouth. We both ordered the Steak Flemington which was a steak in a light pastry crust drizzled with a light mushroom sauce and we split a side of chipotle mac-n-cheese. The mac and cheese was rich and rich and not an over powering but tasty flavor. The mushroom sauce was an excellent compliment to a pretty good steak.

K9k2NVzBSuuWZzlzqwtmjg,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,I recently had a interview where I had to dig out my work clothes and realized that I have outgrown them all. That is a 'good' thing as it's been years since I've had to wear such outfits and I've lost a decent amount of weight recently. So I ran to the Express in Southcenter (review to be posted separately) and bought some updated pants as well as some tops to go with. The store ended up having a sale the day AFTER I bought my clothes so I ran back to this location to swap out since the savings was quite significant. The clerks weren't too helpful (I had to go hunt someone down to get me a fitting room) as well as just having one person work the register when the line had more than 2 people in it. I'm not sure how much longer Express can stay in business with tops regularly priced at $50 ,2,3,4/27/2012,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

The coffee was bold and complex - with lots of flavor and intensity - really good coffee!,4,0,12/24/2011,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0
k9o_oLYjNFaXC3MWCCuGHw,DKr_qJHG7S6CoSd-Qv4BuQ,This is a great after hours bar to grab a drink with friends who work down in the loop. I visited home for the first time in a month and it was really nice to get back into the groove of Chicago. It's definitely different and less techno pop is played than in California. People are more into classic rock and even more country. I'm really a big fan of the old guiness signs that they have on the wall here. And of course you can't forget that they have 312 on tap.,4,3,10/28/2008,DKr_qJHG7S6CoSd-Qv4BuQ,0,69,1

The great thing is there is never a wait! You get to glide around the park in your own little relax-mobile while taking in the Disney atmosphere and people watching from above. Keep your fingers crossed that Space Mountain will have one of it's mechanical issues and all the lights will be on inside that ride. It's very cool to see it with all the lights on but also kind of scary once you actually see what you're riding around on in there! haha Love the TTA and it's always a must do for me at Magic Kingdom!,5,1,8/21/2011,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,76,738,0

Kam4hot2KP2oEtw8881HLQ,CYYgGVIAzYZHojYqHzgCJw,Epic failure when it comes to property management.  The two things they excel at are not communicating and collecting assessments and late fees. My HOA recently had a vendor lockout and Action's response was to have the homeowners go out of pocket to restore a vital service in DTLA (parking).  Deadlines are constantly promised and missed.  They even  charge a $20 convenience" fee to use their autopay system. Their vendors are rude and do not know what they are doing.  ProTec came out to service our boiling system and set the temperature to 150F.  Legally it needs to be somewhere between 120 and 135. I would only wish the service of these people on my worst enemies.  We did better without any management company or when we were with the management company who was actually stealing from us.

They have really good tempura and white tuna sushi.  This is a family owned business and everything is cheap. The managers are always greeting each table and even run food for the guests. Don't compare it to Nobu. It's not going to be like that as this is a family owned place. It's a popular place after 5pm and at lunch time so be prepared to wait a little bit but the servers are always helping each other out so you're not left with empty water glasses or without help if you need something immediately. I love their hefty serving of shrimp tempura and their sake is cheap. It's pretty satisfying and the sushi rolls are not trying to hard to be trendy.

We wanted to get an early start because we wanted to see the sunrise from the top of Starved Rock and we knew how popular the place is and we knew it going to be packed. The early weather forecast called for severe thunderstorms and there was a tornado watch in effect for the area. This did not deter us from our course of action. We arrived there at around 5:45 am and the entrance to the park was an obstacle course. The road was littered with large and small branches including an entire tree that fell across the road.

When there is a wait before you get your table they will bring you out some of the cheese bread which is melt in your mouth amazing. The service is terrific and out there they offer valet if you are lazy to go find street parking or just don't want to park at a ramp near by which is about the same cost as valet to begin with. And if you go during restaurant week as I have done in the past the meal comes with dessert for the price of dinner alone but be sure to make reservations because they get booked quite quick during this time period.

The location is perfect because you are in the middle of the strip and next to the Paris Hotel. You are also across the street from the Cosmopolitan and the Belligo.

But the staff was helpful and very proud of their workplace - they were very open to answering my prying questions about their business. I've never heard of such a concept before so the whole thing was fascinating to me. The store was literally teeming with shoppers at all hours of the day.

As a 60 hour weeker I like to prepare the food with sauce in these pans and just dump it in the oven each night - hello = 3 for $1!!!!  Now that's friggin good.

Fortunately we got there between big groups of people coming in to eat so we only had to wait a couple of minutes.  I knew things were going to be good when I saw the Cuban bread french toast listed as one of the specials of the day.  It rates as a diner to me when you get your coffee in one of those you can give somebody a concussion with it white heavy mugs.  Theirs had advertising on them! It is a small place and the decoration is just something you have to see for yourself.  It is wild. I loved that painted Ph,4,1,7/29/2012,dk5yqirSwDH7Cpp52NdhUA,35,302,0

It has to be in order to upkeep the location but I can't recall last time I didn't just download an album for 1/2 the price.,3,0,9/6/2011,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

We sat at the lil bar in front and the boys ordered a drink from the lovely bartender.He was very friendly and polite. Instantly out table was ready!

Biggest disappointment was the outdoor patio area was full when we came as the warm heaters on the cool night would have made a great outdoor dining experience. Wait staff was prompt and friendly with good recommendations. Calamari appetizer was excellent with jalapeno peppers and a spicy sauce. Almost too large for two people though. The walnut martini drink was really good. Duck breast and risotto was good but the risotto wasn't as good as the duck itself. Would definitely go back.,4,1,2/5/2012,8UclkIRBu_0071zkBYo0Ig,2,65,0

I ordered the Lemon Grass soup with shrimp and the Papaya salad. I used the terms Tom Yum" and "Som Tum" when I ordered. These terms are not used in their menu - I was under the impression they were fairly standard terms for these Thai menu items. In any case - she had no clue to what I was referring to - so I used their terms. Soup came out immediately - soup was not very spicy or lemon grassy - which is ironic given the name of this place.

I was the only one in the store and had a really nice conversation with the owner about her wine selection. She ended up suggesting a Spanish red I had not heard of that turned out to be awesome.

konyrXXUqoqmD0liu0cxvw,jgPOl8penY4km_zdEYRAhg,Wow I'm surprised at the negative reviews.  My husband I purchased our 2010 Nissan Rogue Krom edition from Performance Nissan the end of January of this year.  We had an Xterra and preferred to purchase another Nissan.  We test drove a rogue as well as a Murano.  We liked both and not once did we feel pressured to purchase the more expensive Murano.  We got what we wanted on the trade in of our Xterra and so far have had no issues as far as service.  Everyone has been friendly and helpful.,4,3,7/7/2010,jgPOl8penY4km_zdEYRAhg,10,169,0

I booked and prepaid for a room with two beds at http://www.hilton.com.  When I arrived I was informed that they do not have any rooms in inventory with two beds and that sometimes websites get it wrong.

My husband & I went on 2/14 which happened to be their grand opening.  The Kent restaurant is very nice.  I love how open it feels.  Everyone was very friendly.  It did take a little while to get our food but it was pretty busy.   The best part of Applebee's? Happy Hour! They have great deals from 3-6 and 9-close.  The best part in all this is you do not need to be in the bar to participate in these deals.  You can participate all through the restaurant.,4,1,2/16/2011,jgPOl8penY4km_zdEYRAhg,10,169,0

There are a lot of stairs to go up to the mezzanine... and bringing a carry on up the stairs is hard to do. Their customer service isn't nice either... they seemed annoyed whenever someone came up to them to ask them a question.

KP60aUO2IGjvdBPpwjZPpg,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,This place was pretty darn good. I love Thai food and consider myself an amateur/quasi expert of Pad Thai. It is my favorite Thai dish and I am usually hard pressed to deviate from my standard order. We started off with the crab rangoon and I am thinking that the crab rangoon here are some of the better ones that I have had. The Pad Thai was very heavy on the peanut. I have never had an order with this much of a peanut emphasis and I rather liked it. We arrived here when the place first opened and we were there for about 45 minutes and the place was still a ghost town. It was rather perplexing as the food was pretty good. Our server seemed rather indifferent to us but they did a good job of taking care of us. It was a very good visit for sure!,4,0,9/4/2011,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0

They were super friendly amd made me comfortable in the clinic. My doctor was Lawrence S conducted my eye exam. He explained me everything im detail and performed the eye check exam properly. He gave me some extra tips on how to take care of the eyes. I also wanted to get a new pair of glasses. I felt they don't much variety pertaining to different frames and also they were very expensive. I know it's Manhattan but still they were a tad expensive when it came to glasses.

The place has changed a lot since it was a night club on weekends and mainly handles dining now and private events.  The restaurant space is very nice with a summer patio.  We had a lot of appetizers during the wedding which was catered by Lago and they had some hits and some misses.  The staff were extremely friendly and fun for this event. The dining was nice as well but the view over the canal and the trees were absolutely gorgeous from the second story in the fall.  I'd say this might be a solid date spot for the view alone but I haven't tried anything from their regular dining menu in a long time!

My friend looked it up on his iphone and it said the fest was free. And it is illegal to charge for a street fest in Chicago. The donation is suggested! So we get thru the Wop fest and get to RB. We were seated immediately and the waiters were on top of us the whole night. We walked by the cookies on display and we both knew what we were going to have for dessert.

When we were leaving the owner ran out and flagged us down to give us a thing of white rice realizing they made a mistake. Both combo's were over $25 total!

THe organic selection is admirable but cheaper at Naturally Yours or Common Ground and at least you're supporting a local business when you shop there. The only time I've ever been there the manager was stocking the shelf and was in my way. Rather than move he gave me a dirty look and continued to block the isle. No thanks...

The woman who was the waitress was also the bartender and hostess. She was bustling about the entire time. Shepherd's Pie usually takes longer than other menu items at most places I've been to. It took about 20 minutes before my order came out.

I order the D2 (Marinated short ribs) --- YUCK! I ordered the side dishes separately since D2 doesn't come with unlimited sides. If it wasn't for the customer service...this place would be 1 star!!!

The complimentary bread and butter that comes to the table looks beautiful but didnt deliver on flavor. My sister had orderd the bbq nachos its supposed to come out with topped with meat but ours came out meatless so it had to be sent back. i think the crunchiness of the chips is what impressed me about that dish.

kVx_rkzjuyEgFr7TRH4Pvw,mGiRofzvHBp9pz0KmK9bNg,This place is hard to review. I was visiting Philly for a day and liked that the location was near the Liberty Bell and all that jazz. The interior is cute where everyone sits around the curved bars and the server walks in between them to take orders and give out food. Food quality was probably a 2/5 stars for me. It was what I expected though! I went with the egg and cheese sandwich with veggie sausage on a croissant and had a side of hash browns. The sandwich was good but the hash tasted funny. I guess they were just cheap. This place has appeal and comfort going for it though. That's why I bumped it up to 3/5 stars.,3,1,1/3/2011,mGiRofzvHBp9pz0KmK9bNg,7,138,0

But the open area was very much to my liking.They had a small 2 member band playing and another band was setting up for a later gig on a larger stage.The 2 member band was rather entertaining. Now the food. My wife started with cheese sticks.  She gave them a 3 out of 10. I did not eat them. I had a pizza which i would give a 5/10.  A lot of toppings and the sauce (their special hot sauce) was good. The crust was the culprit ... very thin and soggy.

This restaurant chain is also an award winning franchise. My only reason for the three stars is the fact that they only accept cash payments and no credit or debit cards. They do need to get in touch with technology as to how things are paid for since not everyone carries a lot of cash on them. It's easier for them to use a debit or credit card to pay for things instead of having to hunt down an ATM. They would be better off if they accepted credit cards as a form of payment.

kzxRINHnjNjy7TZ4HlolFg,0TWqlGuQYMwgpiNCi5we2w,Go on Sundays when it's free and don't go more than twice a year. My first trip to CMA was 5 years ago and I gave it credit for being decent in relation to the size of the city.   I come several times a year to see what's new or passing through. Like everyone else I am not sure what was renovated besides the children's area and my 3 year old son quickly lost interest in that. My latest visit was a bit of a let down because I came to see the Caravaggio exhibit. What I didn't know is that it was just one Caravaggio and the rest were paintings copying his style or subject matter.

Not only did you have to wait forever to get your food.. you have to try to battle their crazy driveway to get out. The curb doesn't go flat and has a bit of a lip. For someone who's not a regular; I had quite a adventure trying to get out and make sure I didn't drive my car off the curb.

I can barely move and am surprised I'm able to type anything in my current food comatose state. Everytime I go to a Yelp Elite event I say it's my favorite yet...but no! I swear! This has been my favorite thus far! We got there about ten after 7 and got a nice booth for my Elite friend Phillip C. and I. Then the barrage of food began! Servers brought out tons of samples of burgers & sandwiches cut in quarters for us. Everything I tasted was just fantastic! My personal favorites were the Sin City Burger (a special exclusive!) with an egg and bacon on it and the Smashed Chicken Sandwich. I would venture to say it's one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had. I'm not sure what it was about it...perhaps the smashed chic,5,6,1/31/2011,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,76,738,0

I've also been for lunch before and the food is decent cafe food. I still probably would choose Panera over ele for food but that's only because Panera has more food choices.

I must say that our server was one of the friendliest we have had at any South Bend area restaurant.  She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed.  Even though she messed up my daughters order I do not hold that against her in my rating...cheeseburger with no MEAT can be confusing to anyone outside of Chicago. My wife and I both ordered brisket.  It was very tender and lean.  Sometime Famous Daves can tend to overcook and dry out their brisket...but not this time. The Devil's Spit sauce is near perfection...hot and spicy.  The Wilbur Bean are my favorite baked beans in the world.  They are full of pork and have a little zing to them.

I arrived about 5:45 pm. I was promptly seated at a two top - there was a reserved" sign on the table that the waiter picked up - I'm guessing they had a lot of Valentine's Day dinner reservations set for later in the evening.

Upon arrival the doorman was disgruntled and did not want to assist us with our luggage so we just hauled it in ourself.  We waited in line with our luggage and it took about 20 minutes before we were checked in. The entire cost of my 5 night stay totaled 2200.  When we checked in the desk staff informed us that they would need to actually charge our credit card 6000 to cover our stay.  They not only wanted to room cost but an additional 500 a night in extra charges.  As we use only debit cards I had to spend the next 30 minutes on the phone with my banks transferring funds.  The stress of this ruined the rest of my stay in New York. ,2,0,10/13/2012,xu1KjFlBNaWBKcnuqltY7w,5,24,0

I forgot that this location existed since I normally don't go down Northgate Way this far. QFC is a place that's known for their 'higher' quality which usually translates to higher prices as well. I only buy things that are 'on sale'. They typically do have better produce than most and that is a selling point. I was also super pleased to find they finally carry a brand of Popsicles that I really love and had only been able to find at Fred Meyer.

The ice machine on our floor was broken so we had to go to the first floor machine which was also out of order so we had to go to the desk with our bucket. Oh I forgot even though the place was empty they put us in a room with a view of the roof and the air conditioners. On Saturday morning we had a wedding and didn't leave our room till about 11.

I was actually craving a burger yesterday/last evening - so it was time to listen to my inner burger demon!

Saturns are known to have a lot of engine problems and in my boyfriend's case his car has a rebuilt engine and also had a recall sticker which wasnt disclosed to him when he bought it and one red flag that signaled to me that this place was selling bad cars is that they don't let you test drive a car which is NOT how a legitimate car dealership runs things.

The only suggestion I have is maybe they could make a time for 18 and up on like Saturday nights. I couldn't believe at 11:30 at night how many kids were there for their lights out.

The trails that cut through the greenery are in very good condition. My only beef is the way some of the tree passages are so narrow or impossible to go over that you have to bring your momentum to a halt to ensure your head doesn't meet a tree trunk or jagged rocks on the ground. However you do have plenty of vision to adjust your riding and avoid any serious issues.,4,4,8/28/2009,Y4Du3cllZ_gpNjzTvmeZ0Q,206,562,0

The pizza is also good if you just want something light. The location is very convenient if you are doing the touristy things like independence hall. I would give it another star if the service had ever been memorable.

Le6PU3FSqAcy8AZR3oxKPA,cdJp91yBttbZHEe2LmZ_Fg,Let's just say Applebee's is safe. At least in my experience it has always been predictable and I always get what I expect. My recent visit to the Albany Applebee's was with my wife and some friends and we went to eat and watch Oregon State play UCLA. We sat in the bar area where we could see the game. The bar tender was also our waiter and as expected he was friendly. My wife ordered chicken sliders which are an old menu item that can still be made. This is why I rate Applebee's as just okay. My wife and I go to Applebee's to get comfort food. These are foods that  are good because they are predictable. So when the menu changes and the items we come to rely on are dropped from the menu we no longer have a reason to eat there. This happened when Applebee's had onion peels on the menu and t,3,1,11/8/2010,cdJp91yBttbZHEe2LmZ_Fg,1,11,0

Plus not to mention the biscuits were dry and could have used a light sweep of butter. They also have this mode of taking orders behind a bullet-proof plexi-glass window that indicates how African-Americans are treated  in certain neighborhoods. You're treated like a criminal by talking to someone through a speaker and it's usually some hoodrat that works the register. I usually don't eat at KFC since half the locations I go to are usually staffed with hoodrats and people with serious attitude problems and ignorant management.

There are no elevators but the hotel is only 3 floors. The place was quiet but the resort was packed. There was plenty of parking. I felt safe and my room was great and comfortable. The kitchen was good too. I was able to feel at home. They have free happy hour and food every night. It's what you would expect for free food.

The sauce is very good but since we went there right around closing some of us in our group said that their chicken was a little dry. Mine was not dry at all fortunately and the potato salad was excellent too as I have never found one that had quite the taste of the stuff I had here.

I figured if we were stopping somewhere it might as well be somewhere where I could enjoy a tasty beverage. Enter in Dunkin Donuts. This one had ample parking but there was a solicitor outside which left a bad taste in my mouth. They have to ring you in to the bathroom which is all good since I could see it being a problem with random stragglers coming in just to use the restroom. However my beef is with their combo meals. At every other DD I've been to across the country you can sub out an iced coffee for the hot coffee their meals come with (usually at an additional charge).

The one thing I immediately notice from Lake Michigan is how clear and beautiful the water looks.  It reminds me of something you'd see in the Caribbean.  I'd jump into Lake Michigan and swallow the water it looks so clear!  Yes I know it's probably a bad idea but it's that nice looking.  Between the beaches and parks built on the waterfront the lake is easy access to a lot of people.  I really like that there are so many amenities built on the lake and it's not littered with condominiums and houses all over it.

I was waiting in line to pay and there was 5 registers open on a Sunday afternoon. So it was a 10 minute wait. No big deal until the front end manager started yelling across the store to get more people up front. It was comical. He was screaming at this one girl to open up her register and she gave it back to him. I'm suppose to be out of here and it's 3:25! And the sweat is just dripping off of him because he doesn't know what to do? I finally get to check out and I pull the coupon off of the product and I put it on top of it. I see him take the coupon and put it under the register. I assumed he scanned it. When he told me the total I asked about the coupon and he told me that I didn't give him any.

This is a fairly big airport or so it seemed with the stairs I climbed and walks I made to get to my gate. My flight departed at 7 am midweek so the airport was a little busy but check-in went ok but that is because Delta had technical issues with getting me checked in. Getting though security was quick; 10 minutes tops. The walk from security to my terminal was pretty long but I didn't mind getting the exercise so it worked out perfect.

We ordered a TON of sushi and specialty rolls.  Because of the size of the order it took awhile.  My son that doesn't like sushi ordered the BBQ Eel and loved it (BTW).  The sushi arrived on HUGE platters and we dove in.   Everything was flavorful and was enjoyed immensely.  ",4,0,12/20/2008,bXmJD9Xcr8H1wgIkjC1Blw,119,320,1

Plus not to mention the food was sloppily prepared--ordered a snacker when they first came out and had wilted lettuce and gross looking sauce on it. This location was eventually closed down probably due to sanitation violations since they were shut down before for some kind of sanitation violation.

This store should be renamed from a Holt Renfrew to a Holt Renfrew express.  It's so small and the selection here is terrible.  Compared to the Holt's in Montreal and Toronto this place is a shack.  They carry suits and an extremely small collection of other things. To round out their small collection I've never run into such rude staff on 2 separate occasions.  Not only are they not helpful but to be honest they've been jerks.  I was birthday shopping for my mom and looking to get her a purse.  I had asked to look at a Prada purse and actually had to run around to a few people until someone would actually help.  When they helped to get me a purse the sales person pretty much tried to make me feel like I couldn't afford the item.  I wouldn't be in Holt shopping for an item t,2,2,3/6/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,157,605,0
