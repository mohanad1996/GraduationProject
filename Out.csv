2eJpQ2HAnRQRp2v7XLA,ORdirlxcallT7dzlZlW2A,I came to Chicago on business and was initially supposed to stay downtown; however a colleague recommended this hotel--and I am so glad that they did! The attention to detail and finishing touches in my room are what made this hotel feel like home. Staying in a smaller hotel allowed me to connect with the local Chicago vibe while simultaneously enjoying exquisite service from the staff at a fraction of what it might cost to stay in a Magnificent Mile high-rise. Considering the quality ambiance and charm of this hidden Chicago treasure it made my trip a memorable experience. Not only was I able to secure a bike rental to avoid the high cost of renting a car but I also was directed to some of the local galleries in the West Loop by the friendly staff members.,5,5,9/28/2011,ORdirlxcallT7dzlZlW2A,0,2,0

87QVdPvgbDK3GeVxFRzg,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhiOxQ,My family has been using Korean Air for many many years now. Going to Asia Korean Air is one of the lowest priced airlines and yet their service is not compromised. The flight attendants are lovely professional and polite. Check in is good and the meals served are also good. The only thing is that if you have to speak with their customer service line it's quite hard to communicate with their staff. Luckily I have some Korean friends and they have done the talking for us otherwise it couldve been worse. All their baggage policies are the standard international size and weight limitations. I suggest not only with this airline but with all airlines to familiarize yourself with their change cancellation and baggage policies before you commit. Airlines will serve the food their country,4,0,7/28/2012,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhiOxQ,43,158,0
99ZJoVHP32iSd4i4nlZw,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,I hadn't been to Grisanti's since a pre-homecoming dinner in high school so I had no idea what to expect.  But since I had watched a cooking show that involved homemade ravioli last night that's what I had my heart set on when we arrived.  I figured... Italian Restaurant has to have ravioli right? Well long story short they didn't (except for the fried appetizer kind) and I settled for spinach and chicken manicotti.  But before I got to that I indulged in copious amounts of the complementary never-ending butter-injected bread with marinara sauce.  Then I opted for a cup of 'roasted onion soup' in lieu of salad (but had salad also since everyone else at the table ordered it and it was served family style).   The soup (which I guess they don't want to call 'French Onion' since that woul,3,0,1/28/2010,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0
ap30mXxdpJQgtNM1lXA,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,I have eyed this shop at the Old orchard location and was thrilled to have time to wander into the Evanston shop. First off- let me say the the you girl who was working (short reddish hair glasses and piercings) was incredibly friendly and helpful.  My mother and I were in the shop close to closing time but that did not deter her from grabbing other merchandise to show us and really helping us!  She was ab Fab. The pricing is incredibly cheap.  I picked up a cape/sweater thing for the office for 38$.  My mother picked up a great sweater to throw on to go shopping etc for the same price. I mean really.  38$?   The selection of gifts and cards is really cute.  I am a fan of this place!,4,1,11/20/2011,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,86,478,0

ClbQ1ewqAO2UGhk0Xlw,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,So this was my first Yelp outing... I arrived right around 7:30 pm - a few others were there before me - we had to stand outside for a few minutes - which did not bother me. We had a little room in the back to ourselves. Before ordering we had to negotiate with our server about the fact that several of us needed to have separate checks as we were paying with credit cards - our server tried to make this into a difficult task - but in the end we got what we wanted. I eagerly looked over the menu since I had heard good things about this place. I was disappointed to see that there was no Poki offering on the menu. So I asked anyway - no no Poki. So then I ordered Miso soup Edamame and a variety of rolls and Nigiri sashimi. First I was informed that they were out of Edamame then out of sc,3,4,11/18/2007,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0
cx83cZLLliSMt0u7Iew,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,Not having a sweet tooth not being a non-cupcake aficionado I love Yelp for pointing out little gems like the Hummingbird Bakery. Am I right in saying that cupcakes are an American obsession which is slowly translating itself across the Atlantic and in years to come just like the indigenous red squirrels of today we'll be creating special protected areas to try to stop the humble English custard tart from being wiped out by its more aggressive American cake cousin? From the outside the cute arrangement of the different coloured tarts in the window display made me think it was an art gallery until the words Hummingbird Bakery over the shop triggered the latent Yelp memories. So I told my friend confidently that this was the best cupcake in town according to my knowledgeable Yelp friends,4,2,5/31/2009,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,754,1693,0
djtmDJvniCJGro9NZyLg,jO44Apni7iJZVVK4HQ60tA,Ok the wait this time was decent despite a packed house.  I went at 12:45 so perhaps that made the difference.  Back to 3 stars. We split a dragon roll  a spicy salmon roll and a crab salad roll.  So sue us we were hungry.   The eel on the dragon roll was really good this time-- fresh and moist.  The salmon was fantastic-- really fresh high quality vibrant and buttery.  Points for drsssing the salmon so it lacked any of those tough stringy things.  You know what I'm talking about.  Those things completely ruin a bite of sushi for me.  The edamame were slightly overcooked.  Like I said we were hungry.   If the quality remains this high consistently they will remain in my good graces.  And isn't that what everyone wants?,3,0,12/11/2008,jO44Apni7iJZVVK4HQ60tA,34,166,0
DjVUqBUVBqW1qJqLcPQg,IXUeKSqli1tWI0utd9KA,My sisters told me at a very young age that when buying a girl a gift you can never go wrong with things that come in little blue boxes.

FooZro174NQtKb2vjHtw,3zxy3LVBV3ttxoYbY4rQ8A,If you think being past out in the backseat of a cab is proof of a kick-ass night well you're wrong. To end the night with a bang you MUST go to Mai's Restaurant for a late night snack (read: feast). It's also a good choice for lunch/casual dinner. Entrees are served family-style (big plates serving spoon) so sharing is encouraged. Top picks: Start off with spring rolls served with mounds of fresh greens (you'll need that extra hydration boozehounds); Vietnamese egg rolls steaming hot crispy goodness with a side of jalepeno-adorned fish sauce; garlic beef (or chicken) infused with soppy sauce veggies and piles of fully-cooked and soft garlic cloves--almost as savory as the meat--and of course fried rice.

gS6qOhU6nJUgwtjAU1AQ,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,BJ's recently opened a location over in Virginia Gateway in Gainesville VA. I received an invitation in the mail for a two month trial membership - so I went in to check it out. I had the option of signing up for a year beyond the 2 month trial membership for $40.00. If I waited for the 2 month trial membership to expire and then make a decision on membership - at that point the price would be $50.00 for a year. So I went ahead and signed up for the year - which means I have 14 months for $40.00. Because the place is so new the place looks nice and clean. I went and stocked up on things like bottled water dishwasher detergent and dishwasher drying agent. The one thing I will ding them on is their Membership Services area seemed a little disorganized.

The staff is great and friendly we were just there for about 2 hours just to eat breakfast. Thank goodness they served us a mini-muffin prior to our order coming out I was hungry! My friend and I went in and let them know we were going to sit outside. They noted they would be right out to service. We waited about 15 minutes. Once we placed our order we had another friend join us about 30 min later and place an order. Our third friend got his breakfast in a matter of 10 minutes. It was over an hour later when they noted they messed up our order (cook staff was looking at tables 1 & 2 vs. our table #12) ....something to that effect.

lLjQKpw6EF6kdWzzHrHA,bTlonpHjT0p7gF8Ex9XlVw,I always get great haircuts here and I have difficult hair.  The shop is unpretentious and there was no waiting.  Natilee takes the time necessary to do it right. The only thing that would make Natilee's better for me is if her shop was closer to my office.  Still the drive is worthwhile. Call to make an appointment and don't be late.  Natilee runs on-time and works fast. Final thoughts:  If you don't already know who Steve McQueen was and what he's famous for you might want to brush up on that before you go.  You'll still get a killer haircut but the conversation will be more interesting if you're conversant about Steve. P.S.  Natilee does great work at a very reasonable price so tip well.,5,1,8/5/2011,bTlonpHjT0p7gF8Ex9XlVw,7,71,0
MSbQOrMG04LsBIvaETdA,mffer6ORgLqxB8ZeemxmHQ,I attended a funeral reception here recently and it was exactly what you would expect and nothing more.  In writing this review I realized that places like this exist for funerals.  It was interesting that the place had 2 funeral parties going on at once.  It doesn't matter how good the food and the atmosphere are when you are gathering people for a quick funeral meal.  For that I retract a few of the previous comments.  The meal was average but it was served by people who really seemed to care that we were happy and enjoying ourselves.  The the bartenders and waitstaff were incredibly nice.  The gentlemen at the stale cigarette-smelling bar kept us all happy. The appetizers were deviled eggs and sausage in a brown gravy.    The meal was a variety of sides beef and gravy and roaste,2,1,8/20/2012,mffer6ORgLqxB8ZeemxmHQ,23,184,0

Qswp1c8HvWt7c7fZ6rEw,crXbzjmEjkyyT95SAwug,I've been going to The Works since I can remember.  My grandfather used to own a business that was right next door to the works and because my brother and I would constantly be with my grandparents The Works would be a hangout spot for us.  I remember getting their cheese fries and their vanilla ice cream and having the only woman who was ever behind the counter take a bite of it before giving it to me. Now after 18 years I still go back every now and then for their gyros and their cheese fries.  The gyros are carved off the spit as soon as you order it and then put on the grill for a couple of minutes or so giving the pieces a nice crisp edge.  With their tzatziki sauce tomatoes and wrapped in a warm pita it is the perfect lunch or dinner.  Their cheese fries taste the way I always r,4,2,7/10/2011,crXbzjmEjkyyT95SAwug,4,61,0
RbPCoQ5HOhsGbyqC20Q,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,QuikTrip is great for sooo many reasons. * All of their stores are always clean and well lit. * You get greeted when you walk inside. * They take checks (seriously this comes in handy every once-in-a-while). * Gas prices are usually the lowest in town. * All of their fuel products are guaranteed although I'm not really sure what that means. This location is just over the train tracks in Vinings about a mile from I-285. It's usually really busy but you can get in and out easily.

SpginJnYRq7bqUptRfSA,bYENop4BuQepBjM1BI3fA,The IHOP in my neighborhood closed after 50 years and we kind of miss them for a cheap breakfast. I wish they'd tear down the old building and build us a new one like this location. The inside is more modern but still very compact and tight. They make use of every inch but doing so puts the tables close together. It also makes the table tops small and crowded once your food arrives. However IHOP serves up a good cheap breakfast. Their Breakfast Sampler gives you everything you'd want for your morning meal. You'll enjoy two of everything; eggs your way bacon sausage ham pancakes and a hearty side of hash browns.  It's almost too much food I always bring some bacon and sausage home for the dogs.

Of course I had to stab my fork into every ones plates to taste what they were having (fajitas tamales etc) and the guac was fan-flippin'- tastic.

One of the highlights was the three Shiner beers on tap: Bock 102 and the Ruby Red.  All fresh and cold and only $5 for 20 oz. We had two entrees: the barbacoa special and the enchiladas.  I've never had better.  Usually enchiladas are just a mess of cheese and a sauce.  These were flavorful and bite after bite you could taste the distinctive flavors.,5,0,7/30/2011,WKpzoBoom4OSEe703uxw,29,142,0

PATHETIC! $32.00 for a 6oz piece of RARE Salmon & $39.00 for 5 12-15 count shrimp with 5 pieces of fettucini is just idiotic.

Dear St. Arnold's: It has finally happened.  You've gotten too big and too popular to conduct the tours the way you used to at least on Saturdays.  The place is so crowded that the A/C can't keep up.  Getting a sample requires standing in a line that's nearly back to the entrace.  People are set up on blankets all over the place making it hard to walk around.  It's not your fault per se but it does mean that a little more structure is going to be required before I'll go back on a Saturday.

Unfortunately I wasn't overly impressed with the quality of the food. And because that's one of the main requirements for me to repeat-visit a restaurant I probably won't be going back on my own accord. Still it's a classic local steak house that's worth a try at least.  Everyone's taste is obviously a little bit different the over 60 crowd that was a majority of the clientèle while we dined seemed to be big fans.,2,1,4/13/2009,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0

Agree with the previous recommendation on the kids meals -- they kind of suck.  You're better off buying a regular sized (kid friendly) sandwich like the Elvis then cutting it in portions. Staff is always extremely friendly & seems to enjoy working there.  You can sign up on their website for coupons free birthday meals etc. Not a bad option if you're in the Cool Springs area and want a quick & simple meal.,4,2,7/15/2011,9Cqfe9nx6CtB6nkBx3JvsA,17,147,0

I think it would be unfair to compare it to the places we've been in Sonoma and San Francisco so I'm not going in that direction. This is how I think a wine bar should be in terms of atmosphere and simplicity. We don't really eat dinner here but we get a charcuterie a flight of sparkling wine or any reds and then the fondue dessert. I love it that it's such a nice simple spot and has a lot of outdoor seating.  If I'm not careful I can really splurge in the place so I try to keep it to flights so I can at least have some variety in my vino drinking.

The room was also underwhelming again on the premise that you are a luxury resort.  The room was great if you were the Marriott or a Hilton property and just barely on par with a Westin hotel.  But,3,4,4/2/2011,T9AtZPYC4W81rylyvOOmQQ,23,240,1

I thought the spaghetti and meatballs were good. The balls were light and fluffy and the sauce was delicious. The portion was tiny though. Calamari came with about 10 rings and weren't anything to write home about. Eggplant ricotta cheese thing was delicious and our Caesar salads had a delicious buttery Caesar dressing.

Basically I've had it with this place.  The food isn't that great their nutritional info can only be ascertained via the brochure (and isn't all that appealing for what seems to be a healthy living place) and there's a GNC-like place in it which I find disconcerting.  Blech.   The service isn't too bad which may be the only redeeming factor but there are much better places for food,1,1,7/26/2008,HUmClClluKP5Ur6X7e306Q,128,900,0

We didn't have a view but didn't really need one given the short amount of time we were there. Location is good with a handful of restaurants within walking distance as well as a post office and Walgreens which is always helpful! The lobby is lovely with a fireplace flat screen TV and wine tastings. We missed the tasting so upon check-in the receptionist sent up some glasses to make up for it which was a nice gesture. Even nicer they brought up two full bottles by mistake which we made sure to enjoy by the fire.

But unfortunately for Target I go in to get what I need at that moment in time and that's pretty much it. I am not bothered by the behemoth Target I'm not bothered by the corporate employees I'm not bothered by the creepy people. What gets me about this store is the fact that it's uber convenient for me since I am definitely not driving down to the Lake Street target and to be honest the Target in St. Louis Park is full of snobby people that stare at me anyways.

The food was simply done right. Aside from the half-hour wait the rest of the experience was phenomenal. The waiter was candid which is great at breaking up the monotony of your typical mundane server. We started with the steak fries and  Irish curry sauce which was exceptional considering I'm not much of a fan of either. The fries were fresh and the Irish curry sauce embodied everything you love about curry but with a little hint of sweetness to it. I had the fish and chips for my main course. Growing up in Wisconsin you eat a lot of fish fries in your day but this one stands out because the fish is ridiculously fresh and moist.

However since then they have diluted the brand cheapened the experience and skimped on service so I docked them a star for that. I've always enjoyed going to Fishbone's however bring your Diamond card because they are expensive.  Granted they are not as expensive as they used to be ($100/plate not even ten years ago) but they are still in the neighborhood of $30+/person). They usually have a live band of a decent caliber performing most evenings. The food is generally acceptable and the service is mediocre now. They do not take reservations though and if you step out of line to go to the bathroom or to get a drink from the bar you lose your place.

They are brilliant and they make fun of everyone left or right blue or red etc.  No politician is safe.  There are endless video clips on YouTube and they are the best commercial that this group could ever wish for.

I will admit the service started out slow the waiter would take half of our drink order and disappear. Then reappear with the first round and finish taking the rest of the orders.  Perhaps a dozen Yelpers could be intimidating. Once he started to take the food orders a spark appeared in his personality. He truly seemed to enjoy talking about the entrees and the spice levels of each dish.

However the quality and portions are pretty good (again like Gloucester) and I've yet to be disappointed. On my last visit I finally sampled their 'house special' baked pork chop on rice - my standard HK cafe dish and my litmus test for HK cafes.  It was about $8 late-night and it's $0.50 extra for a cold drink and $1 more if you want the extra-large drink (which is only slightly bigger than the standard glass).  Yup - again even the annoying drink pricing is exactly like Gloucester.

4I5pV6O4Rejw3MM1NilA,TxkLXV9EwygBIXiuW6kvQ,The food was good but the waiter was too pushy trying to get us to order everything under the sun. He must have asked 5 times to order a side of potatoes but no one wanted potatoes. I could tell you about the food we ordered which was good but the service was too much and too pushy. I am from Los Angeles and love The Grill in the Alley in Beverly Hills but they are not aggressive and inconsiderate. I didn't like it at all and it ruined my dining experience.  As it is with bottles of wine appetizers and steaks the bill is going to be hefty so I don't understand why the waiter wouldn't back off. It's a shame. Whenever I find a place that I consider reliable I like going back as a safe place when I'm on the road which is what I have always considered The Grill on the Alley. Now no more.

My favorite menu items are the fish tacos and the hamburgers.  The fish tacos are delicious I have ordered them on my last two visits. My wife ordered a burger with the usual toppings but she could only eat half of it.  Now you know I'm not going to let the other half go to waste.  Surprisingly this is one of the best burgers I've had - ever!  This burger beat Swenson's 1/2 pounder in my opinion taking the number one spot for BEST BURGER IN CLEVELAND.   I've only tried it once however so I'll need to go back again and eat another one just to be sure.  Previously Swenson's h,4,3,5/9/2010,nOr3aq60yivqgcsoiDMw,76,232,0

This Chili's location is close to the three hospitals and Vanderbilt University.  In fact 10 to 12 years ago when I attended Vanderbilt this place was always hopping with students on a Friday or Saturday night because it was cheap and convenient. (Yes snarky people even Vanderbilt students like to eat cheap-ish food.  We're students too.)  The location is like any other location of Chili's (hence it is a chain restaurant).  The food is mediocre to less-than-mediocre the service is moderately slow to darned slow,2,2,2/11/2012,T9AtZPYC4W81rylyvOOmQQ,23,240,0

We visited for the brunch which includes unlimited mixed drinks. The drinks weren't bad but were served from a pitcher which I always find a little icky (rim touching straws in drinks splash back when pouring etc). There were a few flies lurking.

I went here for dinner last night with two friends...I know Saturday is date night but the entire restaurant & bar was all couples. We even had a lady turn all the way around in her chair to stare at us....kind of strange. The portions were huge! I got the gnocchi which was just okay...not that great. One of my friends got the Linguine with clams in white which was tasty but not $18 tasty! It was expensive!

I left the suburban area of my neighborhood and entered a Mexican city with music ambiance and all the chippies I can eat! I love having a Mexican restaurant in my hood. It diversifies the area. (It also makes me really happy when I can order churros) All of the staff is well-dressed and polite. They are hardworking and you can see it in the service and taste it in the food. The secret to this place is to order chicken or steak. They have the best marinated meats ever. I think their chicken is marinated in a beer and lime marinade. It is so yummy. I also recommend their margaritas. You can taste the love. And they have lots of it!

The place is decorated in early went out of business mexican and burger jointesque. There was one server for the whole place. She brought us our sodas and took our order. Now the meal came with soup salad and dessert. The mushroom soup was salty. The salad was standard issue iceburg floating a pool of water? The chicken vesuvio looked as bad as it tasted. It was bone in but must have gotten run over by a truck because it was flat! The gravy tasted like brown grease and the sliced potatos had the middle cut out of them like donuts?

Senor Taco?  No that's not it.  After texting a friend the name was clear - Senor TEQUILA!  Now that I knew I had to go.  Now.  There isn't anything I don't like about this place.  It's the perfect Mexican restaurant.  It isn't pretentious it's welcoming.  It isn't fancy it's a total dive.  It's in tight competition with La Mex in Downers Grove.  But so much closer to home. Chimichanga suiza is crunchy hot with melty cheese.  I do not like beans so I got 2x the spicy chicken in mine.  The boy had spicy pork and we loved it!  The rice is good too not j,5,0,12/18/2011,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7zkmjg,4,131,0

Rita's on the river is pretty touristy hanging their hats on the 32oz margarita.  I feel for it....twice!! Our server was pretty friendly and after reviewing our receipt the next day I saw why.  After we each had 2 32oz margaritas they added an 18% gratuity to our bill and without paying any attention we tipped 20% on top of that. Wonder how many tourists they get with that trick.  Good thing we had a $25 http://Restaurants.com coupon to make up the difference.  They managed to get that added to ,2,1,6/1/2012,hB5iwMFPVG3dM2zChrgrMw,53,241,0

Thirty minuets later we had a flavorful pizza at our door. I use to be a BIG fan of thin crust pizza but I am slowly leaning and appreciating a thicker pie crust.

What was good: - They brew their own beer (in Myrtle Beach shipped to this location).  The Wheat and the Summer Ale were very good - The wood-grilled salmon.  It was a large piece of salmon with a very good grilled flavor. - Nice outdoor seating. What was not so good: - The wife's Wasabi Tuna sandwich.  The fish was cold.  Sure the fish won't be hot if ordered rare but it shouldn't be cold.  Further it was a bad cut of tuna.  The wasabi dressing was sparse.

I met up with some fabulous yelp ladies for dinner and happy hour deals. I ordered the beef tamale with mole sauce and was pretty sad that there wasn't a lot going on flavor wise. Having to ADD lots hot sauce and salsa to a mole is a sad sad thing but I really needed something more exciting going on in my mouth and that tamale was just NOT cutting it. I also ordered the bean dip to share and it really seemed like a can of Rosarita's with some cheese semi melted on top and some tomatoes and olives thrown on top for good measure.  It was all happy hour prices though so I was sated and ok with what I owed.

Plus there are tons of people walking their dogs in the park at night so you can do some doggy watching out the window if you want to take a break from staring at your laptop screen. I also think their coffee is much less bitter than the stuff at Starbucks and their dessert drinks are way more creative and yummy (Campfire Mocha anyone?). They're open until 9:30 p.m. on weekdays which is decent. I'd prefer a 24-hour Caribou but we have to make compromises somewhere I suppose...,4,1,3/21/2011,D7R935yDAGHVXBj9wkG31g,36,333,0

I guess the decor was elegant even if I wasn't looking for elegant. The prices were rather 'elegant' to match at around €14-20 per person for dinner a la carte. I also ordered a mojito which rang in at a whopping €9. In fairness the food was as hearty and spicy which I enjoyed. Hubs loved his dooky (poop joke ha ha ha) gumbo.

I had been meaning to check out Happy Elephant anyways and they are so close that I really didn't have an excuse not to try them. They have a great menu with a variety of foods. I ended up getting the eggs rolls crab rangoons and the Peanut Chicken Rama. It was delivered quickly was still hot and fresh and tasted wonderful! I really love the peanut sauce they use for the Peanut Chicken Rama. Everything was very decently priced and the service is so friendly. I will most definitely be going back!

5Pjn5b15aq5sDS3rsQBg,UlWDGR0QrBbdFsVY6ugocw,Here's a quick question for Al... if you're charging me $20 for two rum & diets why can't you afford to have more than ONE server working on a busy Thursday night? Jeezus. I was thrilled when I found this place because after a long day all I wanted was a drink so I found a seat and waited. And waited. Oh and hey then I waited some more. One my waitress arrived she was really nice but you can tell she had way too much work on her hands. I didn't end up ordering food because I was afraid it would take too long & I'd miss my flight but I was happy to sit here and people watch while sipping my drinks. Which I might say were mostly ice... that makes the $20 bill sting even more. Oh well. When you want a drink you want a drink.

As I approached the Future of Flight building I was getting excited as I saw rows of new aircraft parked up and the enormous Boeing assembly building. The experience consists of a 40 minute tour of the assembly plant and a walk round the museum. The tour started with multiple warnings (to be often repeated) about no electronic equipment. At least there were cheap lockers for rental to leave your stuff in the main building. There were 2 short films in the museum building but these were disappointing. No voiceover no explanantions very crackly film like they had been shown too many times. Then we boarded a bus to got to the main assembly hangars and we were told that this was the largest buildi,2,2,9/20/2007,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,754,1693,1

Yes it's a foot long but there's only a couple of slices of meat and they rely heavily on condiments for flavor. With that said I had an amazing experience here. Apparently my grandmother is a big fan and we stopped here on our way back from running errands in Austell. The subs are mediocre. The employees are awesome. My grandmother is a very young 84. She likes to ask a lot of questions and probably repeats herself sometimes. It doesn't bother me because I love her (and she acts 15 years younger). Someone working at a sub shop could probably get frustrated. Not here. They were patient pleasant and way nicer than they had to be. I appreciated it.,5,0,4/23/2011,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,270,932,0
5t6PkDwEZZMApxdKjCxw,BJPDZ1zQalqd79NIUXrmA,So there is a deal where you pay $25 and you get sangria and three small plates. Which is a pretty decent deal except the sangria is not all that great. Maybe I just make really good sangria but me or my boyfriend were not very impressed. My sources say that the sangria is just a mix of their leftover wines with fruit added in. We each ordered our three dishes the only one we both ordered was the lomo de cerdo which was amazing and everyone should order. We also had the seafood and noodle dish which wasn't bad but was VERY seafoody but rather filling for a small dish. The crab cake balls were excellent and so was the pork ravioli. The one dish I definitely do not recommend getting is the tortilla espanola there was nothing going for that one.

5wL4S558cO3mhD1CDiP0A,6NzBPgiGogRZnN8Jx1pKw,Before going in for a Saturday night after dinner drink I was wondering if the Upper East Side bars have the same scene they've had for decades.  The answer is yes. Youngish guys looking their best to impress young ladies.  If the boys have no chance they get too drunk and burden their friends and sometimes those around them.  As for the ladies they too are on the prowl or hanging a little less drunk then their male counterparts. Overall it was an OK experience but seems a little too stereotypical for a UES Saturday night. I certainly don't think Sherlock Holmes would frequent this establishment.

63fk4LloUblppAtaz2A,XVzO3JQWRaxSYNCxqjp2cA,EDITED (08/26/2008): I got a personal call regarding the following review which was originally rated 1 star. To make a long story short it is good to see that Morton took the review seriously and wanted to apologize about the service that I had received. Thanks to yelp and thanks to Morton's for making extra effort to provide better service for its guests. For a first class joint with fantastic steak it is both service and food that compliments each other. Morton's went a step ahead to make it perfect. I am leaving the original review as is so go with an open mind and hopefully you will have a great time - enjoy the steak regardless:) Original Review: Steak was good. The rest was terrible.

6DljyngXYRT0cbCu7ZRcg,ungvfMPW7P7ZzLMW48Rg,The four stars is based on the fact that this is a sandwich shop not fine dining.

I can't say too much  about a  variety of sandwiches as I always get the deluxe original with jalapeno bread and put their name brand hot sauce an it. Great sammy. On my last stop I arrived right at 1030 and was greeted by two friendly employees setting up.  The manager hadn't set up the cash register yet but they went ahead and made my order and ran the card later.

Once you have it in you r cup you take a walk over to the toppings bar where they have dozens of toppings. I only have two concerns here 1) The cups are large and they charge by weight. This could be VERY dangerous to my wallet. 2) I am worried about getting too adventurous with my yogurt flavor/topping combos. What if I make a clunker that I can't stand? I don't want to be the jerk complaining since I am the one who made it! They do offer sample cups which helps my decision out quite a bit.

Our food took for.ev.er. to reach us and our waiter was nowhere to be found most of the time especially when he knew we had flagged down someone else looking for my cup of soup they forgot or my mom's side salad that they also forgot.

79dK1n7tbkZlpSVoLz9Q,e5VFAIWBHBL7PFMNArDg,We started off with the empanadas and pupusas not something I would expect to see on a Mexican menu. The empanadas had softer dough shell (not flaky) that was stuffed with either pork chicken and cheese. The pupusas were round pancake like corn disks filled with either pork or cheese. The pork had the best flavor and the texture was a cross of a pancake and corn bread. The server was really nice and brought me a  small tasting of the creamy butternut squash soup which had lovely hints of spice. I couldn't decide between empanadas or soup so I tried both! They serve large portions here but we continued to stuff ourselves with the entrees. We ordered the Carnitas Uruapan Chicken Mole Carne Asada and a daily special of ribs. The Carnitas were tender chunks of pork that had been simmerin,4,3,1/11/2012,e5VFAIWBHBL7PFMNArDg,46,307,0

So alas a few nights ago my boi and I searched around for dog-friendly eateries to take Tex. A quick phone call to LB's and we were money.

7b9IOloLlnNTuM3cZdg,k3ICHfTb433rFxAO3BsqEg,Your average business hotel.  I visited for three days in June '12 and thought it was nice.  The architectural layout is interesting.  The rooms are on the perimeter and the lobby and restaurant are located in the center of the first floor.  The Glass ceiling allows sunlight to beam down and illuminate the indoor area making windows facing the hallways very sensible. I'm probably not the first to say this but the rooms are a bit stodgy.  They could use new carpet and the TV's look between 15-20 years old.  Big plusses with this hotel - Burger Bueno and In-N-Out burger are located just across the hotel parking lot.  So is Walgreen's for the added convenience factor.,3,1,4/16/2012,k3ICHfTb433rFxAO3BsqEg,8,142,0

This just doesn't seem right to me especially considering that an Internet search indicated that similarly-sized ones seem to be going from other salvage places for a third of that price.

Sure Maxwell's is a rip-off of other restaurants (they have a chocolate cake there that looks as if it's a lesser quality Portillo's clone; I did not order it). But before there was Portillo's there was the the beloved Maxwell Street in Chicago that gave way to University Village and The University of Chicago. They ripped them off first -- but themed restaurants aren't anything new and I wouldn't fault them on that alone. If that were it. The first thing you notice is the sloppy tile edging work in the turnabout. That shouldn't annoy me as much as it does -- and it probably wouldn't annoy m,2,5,6/11/2009,ySXNLiIspI4UC8Qn7xT3w,34,199,0

Well let's just leave details of my bowling prowess at that. But! There's just something about bowling alleys... They remind me of cutting class to go eat french fries while watching friends' moms who had  a cigarette & noon cocktail habit go at it on the lanes so I will forever some some kind of nostalgia for them. Mission Bowl is not unlike a bowling alley in Anytown USA. Take a break and smell the uh fry grease. On a serious note... that snack bar blows away that of my teen haunt. There must be *four* varieties of fries!! Popcorn! Homemade cookies! And yes a bar (with enormous bowling ball beer bongs). Especially great for kid birthday parties.

I haven't been there for couple of years.  Just as interesting as my first first time.  The museum is very well laid out.  When you go just plan to spend couple of hours to go through this museum.  The museum covers all of the countries of Africa.

Thanks to my Plus One winning VIP tickets at the last Yelp Elite event I was on my way! I gathered my crew of revelers and we bussed it down to the Convention Center. My tip would be to get rid of your cars if you can. Parking isn't great down there and you won't be able to drive anyways. Once inside it was PACKED with brosephs. Seriously just DUDES everywhere. Not to say there weren't any ladies but Columbus' entire population of 25 - 32 year old guys were there. All in plaid. It was so packed in fact that you really couldn't learn anything about the different breweries. It was a mad dash to get in line get a pour and get in another line.

We were not prepared to go somewhere nice/dressy so we asked to sit in the bar. The rain really foiled our drinking plans. We were given the dinner menu but requested the bar/lunch menu for some lighter choices. We decided on the artichoke dip to start. It took a while but when it came out it was pretty good. I liked the tomato basil tortillas served alongside. There was a little too much prepared Parmesan for my liking but it was good.

It's hella busy and traffic on Sidney Marcus Blvd. is awful during the day but it's almost always the cheapest gas in the area. They do a pretty good job of getting people in and out despite the high volume of customers. It's not unusual for every pump to be occupied with another vehicle waiting. As long as everyone pays at the pump it's pretty smooth but a lot of construction workers come here because of its close proximity to Home Depot. They usually pay cash and have to go inside. Inside it's clean there are always at least two people working (probably more) and everything seems well stocked at reasonable prices.,4,1,5/12/2011,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,270,932,0

Right across from me they were half finished with their lunch before I even got mine. Chips and salsa were pretty standard and food sort of bland. Everything looked better than it really was.  Some had tortilla soup next to me and it didn't look like any tortilla soup I had ever had - large chunks of avacado in it. He said it was good. If I ever go back I'll get that and salad. The salads did look good. Usually in a large group they will add the tip. They didn't here. Surprising but good for the waiter since I usually tip more than they will add. The waiter did good considering how large our group was. It just would have been nice to have at least 2 waiters.

This was one of the best decisions I've made this holiday season! The first part that caught my eye was the $10-per-person price tag and the second part was the menu itself: BOTH turkey breast and ham stuffing rolls cranberry relish AND my choice of 3 sides. I chose garlic mashed (completely delicious) corn and cheddar casserole (yummo) and green beans with bacon & onions (very good). Oh and there was TONS of each item. Leftovers even after doling out take home portions to the guests. The only drawbacks were that their location is all the way in Bartonville but is still pretty easy to find and also the storage,5,2,12/1/2011,aZmkHjoEHe2MRl2WxAMfQ,31,103,0

We didn't really care where we ate so we decided to try it out. We had Spicy Calamari and Tuna Ceviche for appetizers and both had Pasta Bolognese for our main course.  The Calamari was good unfortunately not spicy though.  The tuna was very good especially if you poured the soy sauce they served with it all over.  I was a bit confused though as they served soy sauce and guacamole on the side of the service.  So is it Mexican or Asian service?

Fan's is the real deal like you'd expect to find in any city's Chinatown: modest surroundings (but perfectly comfortable bright and clean) and a basic menu with things that appeal to those who want both authentic and Americanized options. It reminds me a lot of Panda Garden in Lawrence a favorite of both mine and the K. The proprietress of this establishment adds a whole other dimension of awesome to Fan's. She's really welcoming and accommodating. For our group she offered a vegetarian dumpling option which is not something that is usually on the menu.

But after my first bite I couldn't help but think the bread is BY FAR the best part. The innards of each Kolache was basically playing second fiddle to the bread.

The one thing to pay attention to: Different cooks have different spice-level comprehension. Some days when I order mild I get mild. Some days when I order mild... I get oh-my-God hot. I deal with it (though it usually means I can't eat any left-overs given the way that spicy food increases its heat factor the longer it sits) but it may be a useful warning for the spice-challenged to keep in mind.,4,1,9/9/2008,VbNMQwizyLjSGeS8u70XIQ,104,169,0

Went on a Saturday morning when the museum first opened - no line - no wait - cool. For the most part the Shedd Aquarium is just like any other aquarium.  However the Jellie Fish exhibit was interesting and relaxing to watch.  Glad that I had paid extra for that exhibit.   The Aquatic show was okay. The views from the oceanarium are incredible. The Wild Reef exhibit was really nice.

I went there recently for a New Year's Eve/birthday party and had a ton of fun. We got bottle service for our group of about 20 people. Prices were reasonable compared to other clubs in Chicago and there was no cover charge to get in the door. Also toward the end of the night when all of our bottles were empty they didn't kick us out of our bottle service area which is usually what happens at most clubs. They let us hang out until they closed. Also the bottle service area we had was really nice.

On each level of the center there was a good amount of food venues as well as shops. Parking in the garage was $20 (which I think is ok for a venue like this) but there was parking across the street for $10 and $5 a tad farther away. Pro to being in the garage is being close to the arena...and if it;s raining there is a bridge connecting the two. Prices were higher than outside venues ($5+ for sodas $8+ for beers $6+ for food) but you shoul expect that when going to a professional arena. Restrooms were clean and there were plenty of them.

The male barista with the dark rimmed glasses is awesome and I told him so. So now he's even faster than before. I think that he's trained his female team to be equally as awesome. They offer extra foam extra sauce and when I accidentally grabbed a rotten yoghurt they replaced it for me. They could have said no but they didn't. It's SB after all!

Entree of choice: the fancified mac n' cheese is spectac. Cavatappi pasta + a blend of fine cheeses + kielbasa = YUMMM! I fell in love with this meat and pasta combo after my first time here and have been duplicating it at home ever since. Always have great service here booths are big and the lighting is low so it's a cozy little joint. A little weird that there's a dance club now occupying the space upstairs haha.

We join our hero as he battles on in the search for Phooooooooooooooooo!!!! I had no idea this Pho establishment was here - I was hungry but had not yet decided where to go - I was on the way to Haymarket after visiting the Cox Communications office in Herndon VA to drop off my cable box and cancel my account. I spied the place as I was driving by - so I stopped in around 2:30 pm. There were several other tables of folks eating - as I was seated I waved off the menu and went straight for the regular bowl of Pho Ga and a glass of ice water with a slice of lime. The soup came out immediately. I was quickly disappointed - both the Basil and the Bean Sprouts did ,2,2,1/30/2008,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,0

I'd say Blush is an awesome place to start or finish your night but if you're looking for a more LEGEN wait for it...DARY night I'd recommend picking your butt up from the really comfortable chair and walking down to Tryst or XS!

The pastries are to die for. The new restaurant which opened about two months ago has a more extensive menu than the prior. The hotel staff was attentive to every need. Rooms are small and the bathrooms are the smallest I have seen but when you consider you are right next to a 5 star hotel and you are paying hundreds of dollars less  the Chicago Essex Inn will be my first choice whenever I return to Chicago. All rooms are nicely appointed and if you can afford the upgrade to the King Suite you will not be disappointed by the space and the view.

AwW5TbRk5b8L5rysskAZg,f1MFQxTZAWJnRQdrouLgA,Well...the pizza is good and they have an above average beer list. That's gotta count for something right? I've had this place on my radar for a while simply because I had been told by people in the craft beer circles that this Northland restaurant and bar was aggressively trying to make a name for itself. This always struck me as odd as the name sounds more akin to Showbiz Pizza or Chuck E Cheese than to a beer bar or any place for people over 9. But not wanting to judge a book by it's cover I went along with some friends. I was closer to being correct than I had ever seriously imagined. Walking in the front door the space is divided into what seems to be a main bar and a dining room. Our party was too large to fit into the bar so we were in the dining area.

The service and the food are fantastic- the best Mexican food I've ever eaten. I love the sharing of the food and they have the most delicious margaritas I've ever had. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the size of the restaurant.

I visited when Griffon hadn't been built yet and this sounds like the premier thrill ride in the park today.

I think they work hard to make the atmosphere one of dining at the house of good friends albeit the house of a top class restaurant chef friend! They build up the anticipation by e-mailing you the menu a few days before your visit and the description of the food is eloquent juicy seductive almost like food porn! You've been given advance warning to work up and keep a good appetite for the day of your visit. They also operate differently from other restaurants by only serving dinner a few times a week and there are a maximum of 50 diners each evening as they don't turn over tables - the meal takes 3-4 hours to ser,5,8,9/30/2007,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,754,1693,1

The faux rock exterior and sign proclaiming cocktails may set you into the wrong mind set. Alas... there are no male strippers. BUT What a fantastic name for a male strip club! CAN you imagine?? You could have an entire theme going. In fact- the clientele was elderly men chowing down... one was even having a hot toddy at 11:30 on a Tuesday. They brought it immediately when he sat down- his regular order! In fact- a work colleague and I headed in here after a meeting for lunch- kind of hoping that is what we would find... instead we ended up having a late breakfast. The decor takes you back a good 20 years or so. Service is fast the gypsy skillet was devoured by both of ,3,1,8/15/2009,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,86,478,0

bOfyZ2dTZQcJTGafNKOw,rij5iD4iU3VVTn9pWeHQ,Probably the best pulled pork I've ever tasted. I have to hand it to them the smoked flavor and tender meat are tops. So why did I rate them only 3 stars? Atmosphere. While the wait staff was very friendly and the decor was about what you'd expect for a BBQ joint (country pig-themed) I just couldn't stomach the R&B and rap music. What a huge disappointment. I'm kind of shocked. The only music you hear in restaurants out here is country and of all places country music would fit a BBQ joint. Heck ever classic rock. But rap and urban contemporary? Judging from the other people at Bradley's on the day I was there I bet most of them didn't appreciate it either. Having said that the place was packed and I attribute that to the exceptional food. I would have rated it 3.5 stars if possible.,3,2,7/28/2009,rij5iD4iU3VVTn9pWeHQ,64,198,0
bOjtdz2sCigZ6PdFA9zw,qgbbuhfSkH5Tna5t9tEA,This is a very cost effective and efficient way to travel from O'Hare and downtown Chicago if you don't need a rental car during your stay.  One way per person to downtown Chicago is $27 and roundtrip is $49.   If with a significant other the fares drop to $19 and $35.   A group I think 3 or more drops to $14 and $27.    A taxi is about $45 one way. At the United terminal the booth is at baggage claim exit door 1E.  The man at the airport terminal booth/desk was friendly and efficient.   He quickly processed many people waiting in the line.   At the time I arrived at the booth after my flight there were about 30 people needing a ride.   Total time waiting from buying my ticket to getting on a bus was about 20 minutes.   Not bad for a busy time of day.  No worse than waiting for a Bud,4,1,9/4/2007,qgbbuhfSkH5Tna5t9tEA,160,279,0
BPNc03NaC65fhNRRLr0w,DeMB9AsAoUMskzRStGnZmg,Okay if you're thinking about signing up for home dairy delivery you're probably wondering how it works. Here's the scoop: Once you sign up you will be assigned a delivery day based on your location. I'm in Baker just south of downtown Denver and it's Wednesday here. You can set a weekly order and adjust it up until 7pm of the night before your order. They offer milk (of course) juices cheese butter eggs cookie dough bottled water chip dips and plenty of other stuff. The deliveries for me are made before I leave for work which is at 5:50am. On my walk to the bus I do pass the delivery truck so it can't be too terribly long before that. Milk has never been hot or frozen when I take it in.

Outstanding rooms with a seriously dangerously comfortable bed... almost makes you want to not get out and have fun in NOLA! The shower-head situation is weird. The normal stem from the wall to the shower head as been replaced with a U so that two shower heads can be placed next to one another. Not suite sure what the point is. There are two banks of elevators to get to your room (check-in is on the 11th floor) but they were fast. My major problems always have to do with nickel-and-diming.

If it wasn't for her I may have never tried this very tasty and healthy cuisine. We had to make a few stops up in Northbrook one day and Lara suggested that we go here. She seemed to think that I would enjoy it. She really did build it up and I was starting to get worried abut this place disappointing me. She was absolutely right though as I certainly did enjoy it thoroughly. We walked in and I had to roll my eyes and sigh. This place just screamed fast food. I saw the long counter and I felt my hopes start to fade. I immediately thought of mass produced trays of product sitting under a heat lamp.

Loaded up the car and headed to this Oasis. Rooms are nice large and tastefully decorated for a hotel room.  Nice desk chairs flat screens mini fridge and microwave. Bathrooms are very nice. Nice walk in glass shower with a large shower head. Conditioner which is a big plus for my mane readily available and mouth wash. Brooke was very nice and cheerfully welcoming at check in.

I had the Italian sausage special and it came with fries and a large drink. The service was pretty quick. The sandwich looked a little greasy. But it had a good taste to it. The fries were good and there were plenty of them. For the price I was not expecting this much food and a large soda. There menu offerings are quite large. I think that a sub has to be in my future since that is what they specialize in. This is on the radar. Hopefully the next meal will be a little better.,3,0,6/25/2008,fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw,356,927,0

Hostess was pleasant and seated us at a table by the serving station. First thoughts were how dark and dimly lit the place is. Ok I can see they are going for the ambiance and mood light like setting. Waters were delivered. Then our server came out and asked whether we wanted any other drinks. I ordered the Bloody Mary which was meh. I love Bloody Mary's this one was boring and not well mixed. I think I had two sips. Mom had a mimosa which she mentioned wasn't that great.

BVzftJ62G44v2SmpXTA,rV6r9Fd6eneEanxuComVCA,Cosi is one of those things I miss terribly about Chicago.  I loved their woodfire-baked flatbread and their sandwiches made with said bread.  I am a particular fan of the holiday sandwich with turkey stuffing and cranberry relish.  Nrom nrom nrom.   Sadly it is only available Novemberish - Decemberish. This trip I went in to get the holiday sandwich and still being on Eastern time mentally if not geographically didn't realize it was only 10:35.  The cashier was nice enough about it so I just bought a lemonade and went next door to Arts and Artisans to browse.  But I was back at 11:00 to get my sandwich. I'd forgotten that their lemonade seems to be made with syrup instead of real lemons but if they change that they'll earn that fifth star.,4,1,11/15/2009,rV6r9Fd6eneEanxuComVCA,26,132,0
bWk9UPNp9NobCHcQ4wcSw,rqY0AQMUtoDQnfgxCNuKgw,I wanted to really like this place. The decor is nice. The menu looks kind of interesting. And yet.... The service was spotty. It seemed like the head of the house was doing triple duty as a waitress maitre'd and bartender.  But so be it. We placed our order for lunch. And waited. And waited. For a salad. And the salad didn't even have the lettuce cut up into smaller more edible pieces.  The rest of lunch was a special for the day (a mexican dish) recommended by the head. And lunch partner got a Chicken parm-like sandwich. The steak in the dish was well-done (and a little chewy). The Chicken sandwich was better. But both should not take well over an hour to prepare. It looked like the few other lunch people there were also waiting a while for lunch too. It's a shame because it's a place t,2,3,5/5/2011,rqY0AQMUtoDQnfgxCNuKgw,34,318,0

BWvRtysvOccEMRRANhsVA,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,Nestled in the Hills sloping down toward Santa Monica Boulevard. I love this neighborhood and this hotel is literally right in the middle of it. Very cute. The rooms are huge! There's a big bed sitting area large TV spacious bathroom plus a very well stocked mini-bar. I had a lovely time when I stayed here except I was apparently right under the pool deck on the roof. That really wasn't a big deal and I think my room was discounted  because of it. It worked out perfect for me because the noise isn't something that really bothers me and they worked with me on the rate to get it closer to my travel budget. I like that you're only a few blocks from all the bars. Micky's is only a quick walk away.

I always visit during the winter months and don't know if they are open so I made sure to visit this time. The price for me and my husband and 4 packs of food was $30 and well worth it. We started by visiting the goats and 3 little pigs then entered then gated part where the deer are. I couldn't believe the deers walked right up to us!! There were different types of deer & lots of baby deers too! Some deer would follow us for awhile it was cute. The park has feed machines throughout it that for 25 cents you get some corn feed mixture. The deers will crowd around you and the machine trying to get the food out themselves.

But alas... all good things must come to an end and this place has gone so far downhill since I started going that I just can't bear the thought of returning... The food is still good don't get me wrong... but the patrons that hang out here (the 'locals') mixed in with the typically snotty wait staff... it's insulting.

I also find it annoying that they did not make enough parking spaces for the shoppers.  Every time I have gone there have been people parked in the grass.

CfKtFqh5vkihqtGDlXnQ,2NpSWoeBa6L065QLrQQ,GREAT bubble tea. Best in New Orleans. My aunt that lives in New Orleans took me here when I visited.  They have the best fresh bubble tea here! They completely use fresh fruits and have a large variety. I have tried the strawberry avocado and mango flavors with much satisfaction.  Not only do they sell bubble tea but they have food as well. I would recommend to go here for the bubble tea over anything else. From looking at the awards on the store walls they have local recognition within the area.  Support local businesses!,4,0,8/31/2012,2NpSWoeBa6L065QLrQQ,10,85,0
CfMqoSYifmoiE9mRdpIXQ,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNniTQ,A friend of mine took me to this location of Torrid at Orland Square Mall since I wanted to look at some clothes for women that had thicker builds or were full figured. My only issue was the style of clothes because half the stuff was mostly gothic in nature. Plus there's a limit on certain styles of clothes for women of larger sizes like skirts and tops. Personally I don't think baby mini skirts are appropriate for women that are over the size of 24 with thick waist lines and hips.,4,1,5/20/2009,heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNniTQ,76,185,0
cFRHB5BFTPqh5jsdFY0uQ,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,I like this place because it's family owned and they are constantly trying to improve their flavors to make sure everything tastes the best. Many of the ices are simple flavors. I go by color more than actual flavor. The blue one I like is apparently raspberry. The two red ones are good... either Cherry or Strawberry. The ice gets scraped into a cup and you have a delicious icey feast to indulge yourself. I only stop in when I'm in the area but sometimes it seems to require an Italian Ice just to make my day. Those days require a special trip out to Memorial. Check them out if you're in the area. It's a nice business with good Italian ice. Yumm!,4,5,1/8/2010,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,270,932,0

Wrong!  Us girls definitely know how finding the right pair of jeans can make or break your day!  I know that I can always come into this location and find a good pair of jeans that fit just right and I know there will be someone there willing to help me find that right pair of jeans.  I'm big on stores with good service and this is definitely one of them (most of the time)!  Only once or twice I have had not-so-good experiences here based on the service but usually the staff here are super nice helpful and accommodating.  They also have some great sales a few times per year so I definitely recommend checking these out if your are getting your shop on at Twelve Oaks.,4,0,7/15/2010,mxZWTtZFbrOaMGFRSoqkg,38,267,0
CGHtULx5Rj4l9PHqEU0Q,d89lRBtRUBqJSCttUXvQTg,Two recent visits force a reevaluation.  On the first the food was still excellent but service was horrible--seated ignored shuffled off the works.  We couldn't even find anyone to take our money at the end of the meal.  On the second the service was great but the food blew.

Seating is comfortable and over the year I have learned when it's slow and when there will be no seats left. I start my day around 9:30 there and leave around noon.

I apologized that I was not an Airport fare"" and he responded it's not your fault and then continued to cuss. It was about a ten block ride or so in the rain - $5.00 - I gave him a $2.00 tip.

They do occasionally put meat on my vegetarian order (which is silly - I get the impression not many people order the non-meat sandwich for breakfast) but are fast and friendly with a replacement. Bonus: There is an amazingly adorable boy (man?) that works there in the afternoons too - he has a directionless cuteness that I find appealing in a maternal way. Like a puppy.

I called 8 minutes after my pick up time came and went it turns out their 'system was down' and all drivers are receiving requests at the same time for all needs from 6:30pm and after.  Well then. I ended up being picked up close to 7pm the time I had anticipated arriving at my destination.

Aside from the chips and salsa which were so good that we scarfed the entire basket down within minutes the rest of the food was nothing special.  I ordered a shrimp burrito and the others in our group had a salmon spinach salad and chicken enchiladas.  None of us were too impressed.  On top of that the service was just ok as well...

I didn't get the impression that the serving staff had it together but that could be the fault of the manager and cooking staff giving them the info they need.

Scoop serves gelato ice cream which seems more creamy than usual English ice cream but not as creamy as Haagen Dazs. There is a wide selection of flavours but not as wide as suggested on their website. Another slight problem is that the queue frequently stretches out of the door and it's hard to get a good view of all the flavours available. They're very happy to give you little tasters if you're not sure of your choice. There is a choice of cones available.

The kids menu was great for my nieces and the sides of rice applesauce yogurt or beans was great. The ceviche was delish. The variety of tacos satisfied. And of course the drinks were tasty.  My Mom (who is not a fan of spicy food) got a tropicale salad and enjoyed it.  My Dad ordered a cubano sandwich.  I had one redfish taco and one corn...and something taco along with a side of the jicama mango slaw.  I think I could eat a vat of that slaw.  Everything was fresh and tasty.   Service was attentive without being oppressive and the staff was really nice about my niece rearranging all the pillows on their bench seating.,4,4,5/17/2011,0Igxa1wAstiBDerGxXk2A,302,917,0
d9jdoHuWnqYElRYmh05Vg,PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,I was in Paris a few months back and came home with a nasty macaron addiction. Trying to find something even close to laudree has been a challenge....until I stopped at vanille on Saturday. Of course I had to get the 40 piece assortment for $35 which is a good price considering macarons are expensive. Vanille gets the texture and fillings exactly right - I'm finding that I like the more delicate flavors (rose lavender raspberry) while the husband likes the chocolate/caramel ones. We also took home a few entrements - cheesecake and chocolate mousse. It is rare to eat a cheesecake anything that can be described as light but this little jewel of a cake was.

They are generous in their sizes though. I had contemplated a agle with lox and cream cheese. My friend recommended I didn't and hey since she frequents the place she ought to know. I went with a regular old bagle and cream cheese and it was ok but I like a little more shmear than they provided even though I did request and offer to pay for more. The atmosphere is great if you like some edge. I did since Boulder seems to lack a hell of a lot of edge. It was the only place I saw what I would consider a hipster as well...back in a more urban area they probably would have passed for joe shmoe though. The patio is dog-friendly as are the patrons.

daEYTLNfYtapNsXJVYMLg,JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg,I spent a lot of time in Victoria Station owing to the fact that my hotel (Sidney Hotel) was very closeby and that the express train to/from Gatwick goes directly here. Also there's a Sainsbury inside and I feel like I was there on an almost daily basis stuffing my face with Jaffa Cakes and Jelly Tots (neither of which can be had in Canada sadface). The station was fairly busy but nothing even remotely approaching the insanity that is Grand Central in New York or even Union Station in Toronto. It's big enough and there are enough exits and places to sit that you can easily avoid getting crushed by financial douches and hurried travellers if you're careful. Figuring out transportation (local and innercity) is a bit of a clusterf**k as there are many different ticket wickets and info booth,3,0,4/26/2009,JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg,172,973,0

I've ordered delivery more times than I can count and have never been disappointed (other than it  taking awhile since I live downtown).

The baked potato (just like it sounds - loaded baked potato pizza with lettuce and sour cream served on the side) Athena Wrangler and Ruby Rae pizzas are all damn good too.

The close proximity to the Fashion Mall at Keystone Crossing is awesome for those interested in shopping. But for a great value this is a good choice.,3,0,5/2/2010,1iJ4HoDOGSeIdyZQG6Qzww,83,192,0

When I go to Lollapalooza in Chicago I always have lunch here before the festival.  The food is delicious.  The prime rib is juicy and the creamed corn is extremely buttery and velvety soft.  I also tried the corned beef.  It was great as well.  They have some nice whole grain mustard to go with it. This is a classy joint.  I would love to come back and have dinner here sometime. I highly recommend it.,4,0,8/7/2012,lQgBcKoDJot2nexLX9mZA,0,113,0

We come here because we love the food and we're treated really well every time.  This is a wickedly popular restaurant in the heart of the gay neighborhood and across the street from one of the biggest gay bars.  You can best believe they get swamped.  Come here for lunch unless you make a dinner reservation. When you're seated expect your host will ask you a lot of questions about food allergies or dietary requirements.  I have a double whammy of gluten and corn sensitivity so they not only steer me clear of anything that's going to contain those ingredients they also will prepare special meals,5,0,6/27/2011,F85UxlQM6YzVxSuddW8BQw,29,267,0

I was only left with a few boutique hotels in mind; but no complaints here. Once I came across W's page on ol' Yelp I was pleased and booked my one-night stay via http://Hotels.com.

The outlet boasts that you can save 30%-70% 'every day' which is pretty realistic. This location is never that busy so you can usually shop without much interruption or annoyances from other customers and excessive sales staff.

What one needs on 6th at this point is to fill a niche other than coffee:  good food excellent pastries late hours events meeting space or some such.  Bluebeard has space but it's not really open late enough to make much of it nor do they offer much in the way of food. Ambiance - an identity - is a factor with this many coffee houses around and Bluebeard doesn't really have anything one way or the other.  It's very neutral,3,5,5/16/2011,Vd5ZQKvhdXS3WgECV78hQ,79,427,0

Service was almost nonexistent largely due to only 2 servers taking care of the entire dining room and carryout service. Steak Fajitas are sliced razor thin and the sizzling plate was 60% onions and I didn't find the peppers and few slices of tomato until I was pretty much done.  Given the choice of corn or flour tortillas I went with flour.  The plate arrived with 2 large tortillas which really don't go well with fajitas.  Usually you get the smaller size size whether flour or corn.

It's rooms a funky and cool brightly colored with an old film camera on display in each room. The facilities are decent with an awesome set of pools too cool off in one with a tall waterfall. The hammock zen-spot was a great place to work on my iPad and take a nap. It's located in Old Town Scottsdale which is like a movie set but small and not open that late. Overall I'd give it 3 stars -- it's certainly not ritzy nor is it in an amazing location and the internet is pretty weak however the staff is amazing and single-handedly earns another star for this review.

No fancy marketing or movies or cute tasting room. Just some taps sticking out of the side of their cold storage container and some shelves holding the merch. The tour is not super detailed but it was interesting. They explained stuff in decent detail and gave the story about the how the company has grown.

eTka5YmMCjgDa4fQG2rQ,bspbvQ0HdWRDkM3YYduuLg,I like this place because it has a nice family feel to it. It's kind of nice to get away from the chain restaurants and try something different. We tried this place because we had a coupon. I like that they had nice healthy servings of fresh bread before the meal and the chicken parm that I ordered satisfied a craving. It was not anything special or out of the ordinary but it did the trick. The mozzarella caprese was traditional and expected but it was very good and fresh. I have also ordered the chicken piccata which is also pretty good. The decor could be updated a bit as it seems a bit old but overall the meal was a typical American Italian meal. I would go back there again because it definitely fulfills a craving for Italian food but I wouldn't go there expecting a really nice ,3,0,4/3/2012,bspbvQ0HdWRDkM3YYduuLg,11,182,0

EujpfB7zIMuGD1s4qQQ,USZx55MA2lG2hBu6PWJA,Located in the heart of K-Town this is one of the few rooftops which is easy to get in. This is definitely not the best rooftop since in terms of view since it does not offer much. The view is obstructed by the tall buildings around. The ambiance of this place is very laid back. This is definitely a place where one can come with friends to have a good time.Drinks are very reasonably priced. If one is looking for a rooftop bar with nice view than this is definitely not the spot. Walk couple of blocks to 230 fifth for awesome views of the nyc skyline.

While standing in line because there was actually a really long line.  I saw they had a Banana flavor. OMG I love nana's and I was so about to go B-A-N-A-N-A's.  All that excitement was building as I reach the banana tap I filled my little sample cup with a dollop.  What a let down it had a very distinct tart flavor...BOO.  I was hoping for a sweeter flavor like a runts banana or Laffy Taffy banana flavor. So I went with Madagascar Vanilla and Strawberry.     They have lots of fresh fruit toppings and gummy/mochi/bobo topping,2,1,7/30/2011,7fDqaGdUMccXQ4bnPwR6yg,76,675,0

The baristas are so very hip the clientele is so very yuppie but damn if their coffee isn't so very good. These people do all sorts of awesome things. Their more traditional coffee drinks are always top notch and while their specialty drinks all look a bit too sweet for my taste I have it on good authority that they are in fact quite tasty. They also do regular coffee in many different forms: drip french press and pour over. I've never had a pour over but barista friends tell me that it'll change my life. If that's the case I'll probably save it for a really bad day. The seating area is a bit loud but it's loud enough that everything blends into a white noise that allows me to work pretty well.

They took our order brought out the chips/salsa and fruit and delivered our food (which was wrong the first time around). It took me leaving with Shadow to go to the car to get her attention for our check. We sat on the patio because of our pup and he started panting after just a few minutes.

The longest I've ever had to wait is about 30 minutes when they are really busy. They don't have a web site - so you will have to call them for an appointment.

For the trey trey out of the 6 of us there 5 got the steak frites with half salad half fries. The steak had no char and was underwhelming. The other friend who opted out of the steak got the sweetbreads. Those too were lacking of flavor. With the selection of restaurants in Montreal these days I probably would not go back.

They bring you a stool for your purse. Granted the second time we had to ask for the cute little stools but that's only because they only have nine and all nine were being used.

frQM8hfG9mfXytFL4KsA,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMSQ,My husband and I visited last year during my company's picnic. It was fun and cool to check a new zoo. I thought some of the exhibits were rather small and the hours of some of the others were wacky. They did have some exhibits that were nicer then other zoo's though. This zoo has a little more difficult walking then others because you have to walk up and down lots of hills like other parts of Cincinnati. You can't go wrong with a day trip to check out the Cincinnati Zoo no matter how old you are. I would like to go back and check it out again.,4,0,4/6/2012,HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMSQ,10,92,0

Three women cleaned the house and it seemed to be pretty quick so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the house was left almost spotless. I do realize that most cleaning services are up front about the fact that it may take 3 or so cleanings to get the house completely cleaned. I was told on the phone that the first cleaning would be considered a deep cleaning and so was told an estimate of between 130 and 180 for the size of the house. Now I completely understand that without seeing the house and the level of cleanliness there would be a give or take 50 dollars. Plus I have two cats. All cool and clear about that.

I like Gordman's because even though they have not as many name brand brands at TJ Maxx they seem to have a better selection both style-wise and size-wise.

Besides a good selection of clothing they also have a pretty big selection of sports team memorabilia (KU K-State Mizzou) shoes pajamas and home decor especially for the holidays.

I love that place so much I was afraid it would be a cruel joke to lure me in and sell me sub-par Middle Eastern food. This is definitely the same with the same menu even. The atmosphere is not as pleasant as the Little Rock location mostly I think because it has newly opened and it isn't really decorated. It's very light and open at the wall along the windows and gets progressively darker toward the back. But it is casual and easy-going and definitely DEFINITELY welcoming!

We tried to keep it simple by ordering the family style (medium spice) and had a great time trying the variety of items that came with the meal. My personal favorite was the beets and lamb. The restaurant staff was friendly and provided a delicious free dessert for the birthday boy. We also had a gluten free person in our group and they made special food for her when we called ahead (very nice).

It's a completely unique experience that I'll try to successfully sum up in this review but it's 100% worthy of a visit during your trip and even if you're a local. Much like many other places I visit in the keys the atmosphere at Pepe's is so cool & cozy... it almost feels like you're in a tree house on their back patio. Seating is pretty limited but you're more than welcome to grab a drink at the bar while you wait and the most important thing to know about Pepe's is that every single one of their juices are fresh squeezed... they actually do it in front of you at the bar.

If you love the 80s. you too will fall deep in love with The Wormhole. I've been wanting to go here for awhile and when I finally did I was anxious to see what an 80s coffee shop would be like and was kind of expecting to be let down. From the second I walked in and saw the DeLorean and all the cool 80s decor I knew things were going to be good. It is a very hipster type of shop it's in Wicker Park afterall but the workers are amazing. Hipsters I'm sure but the non pretentious type which is always refreshing.

The good stuff: - the setting plenty of nature to look at out back - the layout great bar atmosphere plenty of places to sit or hang and the best part is the outdoor patio with its own bar.  When they open the two large garage doors in the back of the place the outside comes in.  Excellent. - the stage although we were too early for the music it had a great location feel and setup - drink selection was very good The not-so-good stuff - the food: I ordered the ceviche advertised on the sign out front and assured by the waitress that it would make a meal (along with the homemade chips).  It was not in the appetizer section but in the lunc,3,1,7/4/2010,uLECTF9PumWkzxHScwQA,166,392,0

Haven't really seen too many bands play though. Drinks are good I find the staff to be good at what they do and they do have some good food. Hummus olives bowls oysters etc. I would rate it higher but I hate cigarette smoke and it can be REALLY smokey at times. Usually have cool music and a cool movie playing. They do have a pretty good patio ( small ) for when the weather is nice. As I said earlier I would rate higher but for the smoke.,3,2,1/20/2012,ungvfMPW7P7ZzLMW48Rg,16,166,0

To *try* to make a long story short we were trading a car in for a new one. While we were out examining the car we were going to buy they ran the Carfax report on the car we were trading. The man that was working with us took us back to his office and seemed distraught and explained he couldn't give us the deal he previously offered after seeing the Carfax - apparently the car had a salvaged title and had all these accidents and stuff. This was news to us as we had owned the car for the past few years and hadn't known any of this. After going over it ourselves and matching up the dates and apparent accident information we insisted  this was the wrong car none of the dates matche,1,6,8/7/2012,ItvyYPGXWNhhbYJqyADp7A,48,275,0

It's actually a nice place.  The bar is relatively chill and the bartender was cool (his interest was piqued when I started talking about the dollar oysters at McCormick's & Schmicks).  The tap has a distinctively good list of beers (including Berkshire Brewing as well as your general standards) and it's a nice place.   Sadly the appetizers seem to end a bit early but other than that I'd go back easily.,4,0,8/11/2008,HUmClClluKP5Ur6X7e306Q,128,900,1

It was fantastic! Some people then opted for bowls of Vanilla ice cream. Then drinking resumed in earnest.

gRutB1PLkLumOkg7Q0w,biZ0fIcZp7BKBJ3EGcX7Q,Wow.  That's all I can say.  Just recently I have started taking Metra while commuting to and from work.  Having come from years of riding CTA/Pace only I was taken aback the first time on a Metra train.  The hours I work are overnights so the trains obviously are never overcrowded and the fact that I can actually stretch out on the seat and take a nap is the best perk of them all.  I can be found taking the BNSF line and only once in the last two months have the trains been running behind  (and it was only ten minutes late).  The fares are reasonable ($3.60 from Downer's Grove to Union Station) and you have many options for rides like a 10-ride ticket or a monthly pass for only $120.  All in all I'm glad I have the option to take Metra and would suggest it to anyone trying to ease,5,5,2/24/2007,biZ0fIcZp7BKBJ3EGcX7Q,268,543,1

First off the grounds are impeccable. Everything is manicured and thoughtfully laid out. It's a sprawling resort so you may have a longish walk to things like the pool or main building. Usually hotel catering is....meh. Camelback Inn does it right though - every meal I ate here was fresh and delicious. The staff was really on their game replenishing things frequently and making sure diners had drinks etc. One of the common topics at this conference was how great the food was - one afternoon they rolled out a cart with homemade ice cream bars. Awesome. The staff here is also exceptional - they are unfailingly friendly and helpful. All around this place is first class ,5,1,10/20/2012,PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,84,498,0

I know the budget etc. but that is crazy. Generally decent friendly response from the staff and a great map program that lets you locate exactly where a problem has occurred. The staff is sometimes challenged by common sense however and you can get into arguments with them over whether a streetlight in the middle of the city is in fact owned by them or CalTrans - even when it has a City of San Diego street sign on it.

And no we weren't strolling in the door 15 minutes to close. I'd say maybe an hour before they were to close. Should be plenty of time to eat Chinese food!

Are you serious? That's your wallet talking not your taste-buds unless money has rendered it senseless. The sushi won't cause a stomach ache later but it still isn't on-par with quality sushi. I blame the overabundance of faux-sushi restaurants for setting the standard for sushi quality lower as the masses are now more lenient with what  constitutes as genuine sushi having most likely experienced too many instances of poor sushi in the past to believe this place serves the real deal.

They asked what we wanted to eat and all 6 of us ordered the filet medium rare. The soup came out and it was out of this world. I have never had potato leek soup before.

I ended up leaving 3/4 of it on my plate. Also the pinto beans were served at barely lukewarm temps making them unsafe to eat. I'm sure it caused potty problems for those who dug in.

It's fun they have concerts indoors and outdoors and some specials (like Dollar Fridays where they have dollar hot dogs dollar draft beer and dollar bets).

Quick to the car exceptionally helpful and always gracious (never have I left the hotel without being offered a bottle of water for the road). Front Desk are appropriately nice and welcoming but somewhat detached. There could absolutely be better planning for staff coverage during peak check-in/check-out hours. Whatever/Whenever is where this hotel falls down and badly. iPhone app orders have been routinely ignored (even had a manager apologize to me stating that a rep didn't have the application open to receive orders). I've had wake-up call requests ignored,3,1,12/22/2011,1uys55OaSi9WMZyPNCSw,26,161,0
HBItxKPYyHgg90Hgba8g,2vJ2e51kdbdAmAoHTr4KQ,This park is on the same stretch of beach where my parents condo is situated. One time my dad and I took the challenge of swimming to the park. But for the walkers this park delights as there are trails you can walk on and don't forget there is the big expansive beach... When I was there last during one of the walks on the beach we saw 3 manitees which were uglier than I had envisioned and much slower than anticipated. The threesome were actually swimming slower and behind us. That was the most exciting creature we saw on this trail. Next time my parents and I want to partake in the Turtle trail where you get to see the dangerous journey of new baby turtles to the ocean. Because there is not much amusement in the immediate area I think this state park is a great family place to ch,4,3,2/1/2012,2vJ2e51kdbdAmAoHTr4KQ,20,178,0

hdr7TgkkY1nhQcPhGVjg,w9TB3lYUutVaVPc7RXhSmg,I'll be the first to admit that there is NO way I would've gone here without all the great reviews from yelp.  The outside does not look appealing at all - scary actually.  The inside is actually very quaint and cute.  The owner/head chef is a very nice guy who makes his rounds and gets to know every table.  He gauges your experience with indian food/cuisine and makes suggestions based on this.  My guess is since this is the only indian restaurant in Winchester he's used to getting newbies that need assistance.  He's very easy to talk to and non-intimidating.  If you've never had inidian cuisine before this would be a very safe place to try things.  He can crank up the spice as much or as little as you'd like.  Everything we had was very good - even the indian white wine!

Got there today and I thought I was gonna have to wait forever for a seat.  The connected parking lot was full and the lot across the street had cars in it.  Surprisingly we were seated immediately.  Waitress was very friendly.  And they have Happy Hour every day so how can you complain about that!!,3,0,6/3/2011,hB5iwMFPVG3dM2zChrgrMw,53,241,0

Let me say they did a great save on the hair. They did not challenge me (it was threes longer then anyone near our table) they apologized took the entree off our bill and gave me a complimentary Margarita. Now the food it is fast cheap Mexican food. I doubt if their chips are made in house they appear to have come out of a bag and just warmed up. Their salsa is spicy and most folks would give it a thumbs up but for me there was too much onion and cilantro in it. When I crave Queso I do not just want a bowl of melted white cheese.

hdxEOzK1MMgYKBnXVHNBA,dD1XwgaHM0oxlx2XeYgZw,My friend informs me that here during regular hours the pretty people come out to wash the sin out of their clothing. And there's science to back him up. It is proven by the census bureau demographically that all the 20-something babes live either in Cap Hill or around S. Broadway. There are also studies out that say the best romantic encounters are in laundromats while watching the other's underwear spin hypnotically into a circle of lust and despair. And those tables for folding your clothing? Just begging for something to happen. Not only does its location serve as a magnet but it is also nice and clean. Fairly new machines - all but one work flawlessly. Driers are efficient. The couple running the place are friendly and mostly keep to themselves.

They treat you incredibly nice as soon as you walk through the door.  The waiters are very attentive the Gauchos( the dudes with the sticks of meat) are constantly walking around looking for people  to serve not trying their hardest to stay away from you.  The manager came around and actually seemed concerned if we where having a good time.  The drinks are also a bit pricey but you can assume that of any place on the beach. This place just seems like a great place to go with a good group of friends or family and have a feast for the ages.

Well first of all as soon as you walk in you feel like you're experiencing a part of Cleveland's history.  Seriously. It's like you stepped into the city about 100 years ago right in the hustle and bustle of everything. What a fantastic feeling. I for one feel great knowing that some things never change. You feel like you are truly a part of the community. It's a place where you can come together and enjoy the different cultures and people who make up this fantastic city we all love.   Secondly I can't think of a bad time to go.  The busy Saturdays make me feel alive and part of a much greater purpose.

hEKHqACUQJpSaaMEZJquA,3qdOo7aWhIHWrKuT9jw3Gg,I've been to Olive or Twist a few times now but haven't had the urge to order food so my review is based only on my alcohol adventures. We snuck in this past weekend for a few drinks -- and to get out of the swarming crowds on Sixth and Market Square because of Light Up Night festivities. Thankfully some fantastic people told us of its upstairs bar area. What?! How did I totally miss this on my previous visits finding only a tight tiny squeeze area with happy hour-goers near the lower level bar? The openness of the upstairs only lends more positive points towards its star rating on this establishment. The beer list is decent and vodka was generously poured (read: not an overkill of cranberry and/or tonic) and bar staff was attentive -- thankfully pleasant given the rush of patrons. ,4,2,11/22/2010,3qdOo7aWhIHWrKuT9jw3Gg,33,314,0

I'm not a fan of this type of seating where you are two inches away from the couple next to you but it seems that's a theme at Paul Kahan's restaurants (I've been to Publican & Blackbird before).

We started with the Fez lettuce wraps... I loved the balance of the chicken with dried fruit almonds and pomegranate vinaigrette dressing.  Different any others I've had since they are usually with mushrooms water chestnuts and more of an asian flavor.

On-mountain most the runs aren't necessarily made for beginners (note how nice easy green run Flapjack drops right into black diamond Log Chute) and the week we were there was unfortunately lacking in new snow. This resulted in the groomed areas being very rough for beginner-level snowboarders (like myself). Icy catwalks and tight turns make for some pretty epic falls and an increased need to be really aggressive with your edges. But the weather aside we had a fantastic trip.

We had mashed potatoes with our meal but they don't have gravy.  The potatoes were fine but I prefer some garlic flavor in mine when I make them.  Our service was great and reasonably fast as well even though the restaurant was pretty full with the after church crowd.

First it's easy to miss.  It looks like it might be pretty seedy from the outside (and based on the late nite velvet ropes and bouncers it can be!) It's one part triangle lunch spot one part lounge/dinner one part steamy nightclub.  A few things about this place... I am a grain free eater the options here for a grain free eater are great!  Double pan fried plantains or yuca or as I had them - boiled.  Personally I'd stay away from the rice.  It not only is something I wouldn't eat anyway but looked somewhat bland.  Go with the Yucca or plaintains!  I stayed away from options that looked more 'hybrid' and went more with things that looked straight up cuban.  I personally had Lomo de Pu,4,3,11/15/2010,Ez0gRasGbvxNmBd2e9VRMQ,16,82,0

ivlOeZRVEJgiyvgZeHQA,h9MZv5I1hvTX1kkzq3Cvg,I ordered the chicken kabob plate and I have to admit I was a bit surprised. The chicken was actually more like chicken pieces not cube-shaped as you would find on a kabob. It wasn't too bad as long as you have some red sauce poured over the chicken. Without the sauce the chicken would be too dry. The sauce was mild (not spicy) and it was decent. I also had the spinach and it was delicious. The food also didn't make my tummy upset which is always a plus. I do not recommend the samosa hence the three stars. Instead of being your typical triangular samosa it is more like a pastried handkerchief with the filling in the middle which is quite strange. In other words the filling can be clearly seen as opposed to having an enclosed samosa. I ordered some kind of ground meat filling (c,3,0,9/8/2012,h9MZv5I1hvTX1kkzq3Cvg,35,285,0

If more people would like to stay home and stay away from the road I'd be ok with this. Didn't want to travel far for lunch so La Paloma came to mind. 2 Barbacoa tacos 1 al pastor torta. I do not recommend the tortas here. Mine was soggy and the bread was off. Also I don't recommend al pastor. It wasn't chopped pieces of chicken (cubed?) like I'm used to but it was more shredded and soggy as well. Barbacoa tacos were fine though.

Though this was my fourth time attending NQA it was my first time joining them for their lunch at Barley's. When I'm in the area I usually choose something else but Barley's is a good option for a respite from Convention Center madness. The burgers on the menu looked especially good but I went with a wedge salad. As observed from my dining mates' orders: it's easy to have many options for your side even with a burger. Fries are not the default and there are healthier options readily available and upfront on the menu. Honestly for this type of place I was impressed with the wedge.

She had such a joy reviewing spices and then signed up for their mailing list at checkout. Their cooking magazine style catalog prompted me to sign up too! Months of receiving their catalog and only snipping the coupons for free spices got me to go in the next couple of times. I was embarrassed to go in only to get a jar of free spice but I assumed that everything else would gorge my bank account. Eventually I decided I owed them one and set out to buy some spices. Can you believe it?! The prices were LESS expensive than the grocery store spices. Furthermore there was a generous selection.

Ok fine that works. But when the EMT's were here one of them tries to distract me while the other walked through my house. Found the EMT rummaging through my desk and asked him what he was doing. He nonchalantly walked away from me. Later the Town of Lisbon sent me a bill for the transport to the hospital (2 miles away) for $3000. Yes $3000 for a 2 mile trip to the hospital in the suburbs.  We appealed and fought this with the insurance company and won.

The place smelled strongly of cleaners and chemicals both out in the hallway and in the room. The carpet had a rather 'sticky' feel to it and the windows didn't open to let us vent out the strong cleaner smell in the room. Also the door didn't close properly so we had to leave it deadbolted at all times. Didn't use the pool you could smell the chlorine out in the hallway before even getting into the pool area. I also do not recommend the restaurant. It was not overly clean and looked a little sketchy. I didn't eat there but my mom staying with me did. Chunks of her chicken were still raw.

The entrees are fancy versions of comfort food with a bit of a worldly influence ( I.e. poutine as a special). The main issue they come across is that sometimes food has too many favors and ends up being too done up for its own good. I'd highly recommend sticking to the burger the Amish chicken or the steak and avoiding the deviled eggs and the sweet potato soup. Though bot the most extensive cocktail menu the drinks are very good despite somewhat expensive price tags and the wine list is diverse. As for the service it is a little slow at times and the hostesses can make you feel a little like they are doing you a favor by acknowledging your presence.  Bu,3,0,12/3/2011,LcEEXlI4xZ00L2lI0wnMw,7,93,1

Nestled in Overland Park's boondocks the OP Arboretum is a gorgeous place to take a drive out to and get away from the normal grind and give your brain some colorful eye candy. If you are into photography (As my wife and I are) you will most definitely appreciate the wide variety of plant species and the modestly chosen colors that are combined with them. IMHO the best time of the year to go enjoy this place is probably the last week of April / First week of May. It's locally the peak for tulips and various spring flowers. At the same time it's horribly packed with folks so do expect a busier Arboretum. The pictures posted by me are from May 25th 2009.,4,9,9/7/2009,Y4Du3cllZgpNjzTvmeZ0Q,206,562,0

K1biXlh2aOkrqmSXaAwvg,wbVznKJZvukgZKsz4EEw,Pricey grocery store but my boyfriend likes to use the place for some short term parking downtown.  You can park at their garage for up to 2 hours then spend a minimum of $20 at F&O and get your ticket validated.  Seems a little pricey to me for two hours but he likes getting something for his money.  :)  They have similar products to Whole Foods (including the coffee we love) at similar prices.  I do enjoy cheese shopping here as they will cut you samples of the cheeses you are interested in.  Mmmm.  The alcohol selection is a little lacking but does have some goodies (like Kwak.),3,0,5/7/2012,wbVznKJZvukgZKsz4EEw,3,26,1

So we staked out some bar seats and were incredibly lucky -- sitting next to another visitor to the city who shared his own great suggestions for beer and food when we travel to the east coast again.

So I am not going into the long story of how I came to adopt my felines but they were rescued from the rough streets of Lincoln Park. Their mother was a 9 month old alley cat. Anyways the quick and simple is that I was looking for 2 kitties to adopt I found these two bum cats that did not match me. So I left the place with my husband and we wonder down Lincoln Park. We saw the Pets-mart and stopped in! They had a pet center. So we went down there and saw my fellas with a sign saying  Brought to you by the Anti-Cruelty Society"".

It is one of those tourist attractions that local residents actually also visit and use regularly.   A local's tips: - The majority of the stalls open by 8:30 although they say they don't open until 9.  Shop at 8:30 if you can - you will get the best selection and avoid the crowds. - Be sure to wander around the rest of Granville Island to get a bit away from the crowds.  Some spots worth wandering off to include Go Fish (a 5-10 minute walk from the market) which offers outdoor seafood specialties with a gourmet flair (opened by the chef behind Bin 941),5,2,12/24/2008,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,1

KUNMgTiCqZRIdHVEaZ0jA,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhiOxQ,I am a big fan of this place so far. The trick is that you have to go there when they're running sales. When they aren't items are just as much as any other stores.  They have a lot of stuff to look at so make sure that you stick with a list otherwise you may walk out with so much more stuff that you don't need! Returns are easy as well. I had to return a couple of items and it was a breeze. I just wish they would put more cashiers. They have such an awesome displays of cash register counters and for the most part only one or maybe two people are working. I took one star though due to they have A LOT of associates in the front part of the store but that's all it is ... these store associates are mostly concentrated in the front talking and chatting among themselves and quite frankly,3,4,4/16/2012,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhiOxQ,43,158,0

Plenty of spinach two kinds of shredded cheese tomatoes and sliced mushrooms on a bed of iceberg lettuce comes with your choice of dressing and homemade croutons. What a bargain!

LM6lj2eBNJFz9aeGb6mjw,5ITdf0mnklCpIUenv5LWw,I have hiked at Redwood Regional Park many times over the years.  However this morning was  the first time that I did a loop starting from the Valle Vista staging area in Moraga (EBMUD Permit required). Although you begin this hike climbing up a hill it then becomes gentle rolling hills for the next mile.  Once you cross the road to enter Redwood Regional Park prepare yourself for a steady climb up to the East Ridge Trail.  It is about a mile up and you will definitely get your heart rate up.  It is also incredibly beautiful.  Giant Redwood Trees and lush ferns.  My friend said he expected to see Hobbits appear from the foliage :-) Once you exit the single track trail through the gate you are on the East Ridge Trail.  My hiking friend and I went to the left and went down the Canyon Tra,5,5,10/4/2009,5ITdf0mnklCpIUenv5LWw,68,478,1

Plenty of comfy armchairs big TV that's usually turned to the news or whatever important Minnesota sports game is going on. Free wifi and there is often free coffee and sometimes snacks/sandwiches available. This is a great place to escape to for a few hours and puff away while working studying or chatting. The place definitely belongs to a core group of regulars who are there without fail but if you show up often enough you'll start to become one yourself. There are still plenty of private corners for you to hang out and work alone if you need to. There's a decent air filtration system that keeps the excess smoke from getting too bothersome.

I'll admit once I find a good place (pizza or otherwise) I tend to keep going back. So I broke out of my Happy's Pizza rut by ordering my absolute favorite New York style. First of all to all you reviewers who said- wah wah this isn't New York pizza! You're right. You're in Michigan. ... Just thought I'd remind you. The pizza is thin slightly greasy lightly sauced and uber flavorful. Oh and in case you didn't catch it yes I said it was greasy. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE! But it is delicious.

I also had the tofu platter veggies were spot on cooked until soft but still retaining shape color and texture. My companion had the vegetable coconut soup which was overflowing with all sorts of veggies and the broth was just heavenly. He also ordered mussaman chicken curry which consisted of big chunks of chicken and potatoes that were simmered in the sweet yet spicy mussaman sauce.  I actually ended up dipping my veggies in his sauce it was so wonderful. We both got a spice level 9 which provided just enough heat without making your nose run. The staff were friendly and efficient. Can't wait to go back.,4,1,7/15/2010,Vu7L3U7kxDyY1VHxw3zw,83,383,0

I also saw two other very telling things.  First they did a brisk takeout business while I was there.  Second plenty of folks of Asian descent in the place.,4,2,5/8/2008,uLECTF9PumWkzxHScwQA,166,392,1

We settled on the strawberry cheesecake and the german chocolate cake- both were very good.  I would vote that the strawberry cheesecake was better than the Cheesecake Fantasy that I used to say was my favorite ice cream from Coldstone.  A scoop was $2.40 - not bad for such good ice cream!   There were two young kids working behind the counter - they were clearly still learning the ropes but it was totally cute and I like when ice cream shops have high school kids working in the evening. :) Attention Ferndale residents: In the recent F,4,6,8/25/2010,nt143HoSFyPLsVNaI1fGrQ,49,266,1

The wait to order and then to get our food was really long though- well over an hour. This would have been OK if we could at least chat and relax but the music was so loud we could barely hear ourselves think.

The baked chicken was very moist and juicy. It could have used a little more flavor though. The beef was o.k. Nothing to talk about. The mostacchioli in red sauce was really bad. It had no taste and there was hardly any sauce. The pasta salad really wasn't any better. The potato salad was acceptible. But everything was cut into huge chunks.

On our 'romantic' weekend in Kenosha to celebrate my birthday he discovered the Jelly Belly factory and had I not agreed to go I would have spent the weekend with a pouting 48/12 year old. It was actually kind of fun. The warehouse is tricked out in a low budget Disney-esque manner with over sized signs and giant videos describing the Jelly Belly process. An ad for JB but interesting. My 48/12 loved the gift shop. I think he spent $75 on discount candy. Yeah I'm like 'how many jelly beans can one man eat?' but he was out to discover the answer.

They are expensive.  But I paid $3 for a Magnolia's cupcake and it tasted like something I could make out of a box.  And I sure as hell can't make a cream puff.,5,0,4/17/2010,YLuB9kMNwY7T7s9PMtkwQ,26,216,1

m7W4RsCigfTO18VQkV9A,QQuy7MENd5YHFhfLaLtPNw,In my quest for palatable Chinese cuisine in the area I am finding myself still searching.  China Wok Buffet in Grand Blanc is definately not the place. They are located in the Grand Mall on Saginaw St. by Kroger. They offer $6 lunch and $9 dinner buffet.  They also have carry out. I am glad we decided to try the dinner buffet before getting the carry out especially If the buffet is any indication of the quality of their food available for take out.   The buffet sucked.  The sauces were all watered down and soupy.  The selection was minimal.  The Fried Rice merely had chicken in it no veggies or anything else (WTF!?).

My friend and I waltzed in here last night and sat at a table that had three small bowls of snacks.  I couldn't believe my eyes--macadamia nuts in the mixed nuts?  Impossible to resist!!!   Love the ambienc,4,0,4/16/2008,0GQF457q0ZjKqh6xWiA,95,1010,1

mcPu077fh81fJ52Um6iLQ,NnrCwpS1i5mZtkGGzmIk0g,I decided to take the Megabus to New York City b/c flights were ridiculously expensive.  I paid a total of $90 round-trip or maybe it was $91.00 with the booking fee.  You catch the bus under the bridge thing where the convention center is located.  You can't miss it b/c you'll see the crowd of people and the huge double decker Megabuses.     I was ok with the price b/c relative to airfare this was a deal.  The Pittsburgh to New York City trip goes to Penn State and then to a rest stop with a Subway in it  then goes to NYC.  The bus was packed when we left Pittsburgh but emptied out when we got to Penn State so I had an empty seat next to me where I could stretch out and sleep till we reached NYC.   My experience was in line with my expectations.  It's not super comfortable to be on a bus,3,4,11/15/2011,NnrCwpS1i5mZtkGGzmIk0g,22,246,0

Ok that may be bit harsh but I really want  to put my fine dining experience here behind me.  Get it?  Behind me? The dogs are basic low quality steamed and slapped into a bun.  The chili sauce is a bit too runny for me but apparently that helps it get squeezed through the pneumatic grease gun quicker.  It certainly helped it go through me quicker. The cheese is liquid squirt-on.  The onions are pretty good though diced beyond recognition they take on a goopy onion-paste appearance. So the overall coney island dog?  Let's just say edible.   Worth a return trip?  Only if I was bringing the police there to identify the crime scene.  Why do I give them a generous two stars if my review basically states they are one bad meal away,2,0,4/28/2010,faaOI6hU64h6SSaF0f11eg,68,518,0

We had just been to a craft fair and various other shopping meccas so this was pretty good but not too impressive for me. The General Store is a combination of a craft fair and a Patina-esque gift shop. I couldn't believe how big the place was! The upstairs has that kitchy I don't need it but want to buy it kind of feeling which I enjoy. I bought a few Christmas ornaments and a wine stopper. The Christmas ornaments aren't out yet of course but unfortunately the wine stopper has already lost it's suction.

So much better than the stuff from a can!! Wonder if I can order it as a dessert? The server is very nice but it's only her.  I've never seen more than one server and there are only 6 tables so it's not so bad. One bad thing is that it's super super busy here at lunch.  If you've only an hour to spare call ahead for take out other wise get ready to wait and hover for tables.,3,2,12/11/2008,dsu43n2DORpB07P1sOOZg,50,322,1

Khao Soi: a giant--it's BIG--bowl of yellow curry soup with soft noodles on bottom and fried crunchy noodles on top. The flavor is medium but I always add Thai chilies to make it a little spicier. Very smooth and enough to split with another person. Tod Mun: curried fish cakes. This appetizer is light and comes with five little patties and a deliciously fresh cilantro cucumber peanut relish.

We bought our tickets in Times Square and a tip - the price we were offered was lower than the offers on the internet. We also got reduced entry to the Rockefeller Centre. There are 3 loops and we did the downtown and Brooklyn loops today. The downtown has more of the tourist sights and my parents found the Brooklyn tour a little boring. The tour guides were informative and the downtown loop lady was also quite funny with great dining tips as well. The buses are completely open air up top and though they supply ponchos be aware that it is very exposed on cold wet day like today. Overall a solid way to see New York.

We always went for the hard-packed ice creams and warm fudge and caramel sauces. Yes I realize that fudge=chocolate but for some reason when this glorious stuff runs down your sundae nothing can keep you from eating it. Anyways I really haven't had a reason to visit a Malley's recently but I needed to bring a little Cleveland treat to my co-workers for our regional trip to DC. So I stopped in and with the help of a couple of teens I found a large box of buckeyes and a smaller box of some sort of toffee/chocolate/almond bark to pack along in my luggage.

I know that you're either a Gino's or Giordano's fan when it comes to your deep dish pizza but I think Lou Malnati's is underrated. Do I think the other aforementioned two was great? Yes but  I think Lou Malnati's can roll with the big boys of deep dish pizza too. If you've never had deep dish pizza before and are going to Chicago give your self some time allowance because it takes about 30 minutes at least to cook a nice deep dish pizza and also the lines that can wrap around the place. We got smart. My husband has never eaten deep dish pizza in his life so I took him at lunch time where he can experience better time to eat deep dish pizza.

Seriously the ambiance of the park is nice but really there is nothing to experience here. I watched a swan gnaw on a soda bottle and then almost choke on a soda cap. There were no lions tigers or snow leopards anywhere. And the one polar bear in the whole joint was passed out under a rock where no one could see him. The penguin exhibit was cool but it smelled like tuna where they were kept you didn't even want to stay there. Sea lions I saw them but I could have seen them from the park without paying a dime. Look I'm not an animal lover but I really like zoos and aquariums. Take my word for it there is nothing to see here that you can't see on the streets of Manhattan Central Par,2,0,8/2/2010,48w8IAwfeATiR3rfuH6ouw,31,212,1
Msbza5hbNosAbEYmPjdaA,I7YQFiIsO82eliq8nqsLfA,Tried Sensi with my husband and while I wasn't a fan of the new menu almost everything we got was well done and tasty.  I was disappointed that there were no side dishes- I really wanted mushrooms.  Also there were only two steak items on the whole menu.  Its a chophouse for heaven's sake.  Here's what we ended up with: Mozzarella and tomato appetizer- I was pleasantly surprised- it was three good sized pieces of mozzarella over fresh tomatoes.  The mozzarella was so fresh it was super creamy and the balsamic reduction over the top tasted just right- tangy and sweet.  The dish needed more basil and a better quality olive oil drizzled over the top but it was above average nonetheless. Proscuitto and pears- This looked like a giant meat pocket when it arrived at our table.  I'm not kidd,4,0,5/4/2012,I7YQFiIsO82eliq8nqsLfA,192,523,0

Ordered their cup of soup and half a sandwich option for $5. Very reasonably priced and tasted good. The baked potato and bacon soup was very good along with the roast beef sandwich that was tasty. It had the mustard lettuce tomato and cheese already on it. Not bad for a half a sandwich. They have smoothies coffee and other lunch options. Good looking bars. Their ginger molasses cookies and their monster cookies are addictive! Nice tables inside or large chairs to sit in. Seating also available outside in the healing garden which is lovely. The friendly woman taking orders filled my cup up with ice and tap water which I thought was very nice. Nice ad,4,2,5/16/2012,mhp7ixQA9dqRqXKYcW3F7Q,167,757,0

Very quiet place (which is I suppose expected on a weekday at that time). My friend fell in love with the booth seats that they had (comfortable wide and long) although the little tables were suitable for someone with short legs like myself. I had a Riesling with my dinner which was this DELICIOUS bowl of mussels and my friend had salmon. Both excellent choices but not enough to stave off hunger at this point.

I was late getting back to work from a dentist appointment that went a bit over but I had already planned to stop by this gas station/ taco place to fill my tire with some air and my belly with these tacos I have heard so much about. I'm not going to lie- when I walked in and saw the menu chalkboard with today's taco varieties I was irked that they each cost 3.50. 3.50 for a taco? Outrageous I thought. But I was there and everyone raves so what the hey. I ordered the Rajun Cajun and the Yardbird. I picked up a bag of chips paid my 8.97 and started hauling ass back to work. I was so hungry I upwrapped a taco and started to munch in the car. I picked up the Rajun Cajun one first which was sausage and lettuce and some creamy good sauce.

First the restaurant has an odor that resembles cat urine (I'm not trying to imply anything).  Second the food had a generic taste to it... almost like take-out Chinese.  I ordered the coconut soup and spicy basil chicken.  The coconut soup was served over a tea light which was kinda festive.  The basil chicken didn't have much flavor to it and it was served in a very heavy brown sauce.  That's not exactly how I usually enjoy basil chicken but I digress.

Zacatacos is sort of a hybrid between your typical late-night taco place and a sit-down Mexican restaurant.  The interior is nice with a lot of space and a lot of wooden tables with solid heavy wooden chairs.  There are a lot of signs about not bringing in outside drinks--I'm guessing that may have been a problem in the past.  You order at a counter and then sit down and they bring your food to your table.

There are quite a few specialty foods which make it a worthwhile trip if you're looking for things that are authentically Asian.

This weeks sponsor was Underdog Rescue and they even had a couple of their foster dogs wearing vests that you could stuff donations into. There were MANY more dogs than I had anticipated and for the most part all of the dogs were well behaved. Of course you are always going to get the over-excited or stressed dog in an enviornment like this so if you are expecting a smooth-sailing night where you can sit back with your beer and ignore your dog this isn't a place for you.

With that said this place is awful in terms of food. I ordered the crawfish andouille flatbread and it was terrible. Firstly it wasn't a flatbread; it was a pizza. Secondly there was brown oil dripped from the andouille which made the pizza soggy. Thirdly because the pizza was soggy it was hard to eat. I was picking at it so badly that the waiter and the owner talked me into getting another dish. I decided on the Scallop Mac Daddy. It was better but not by much.

I was expecting a real second stage and not something as makeshift located in back of the venue. Lawn seating is pleasant and far removed from the performers-- to be expected,2,1,5/10/2009,hcPgGmQODKk5MLcfmc8oiQ,55,200,0
OrHPoIVhW80eQVQUbI7Q,zKB3C4FXEUSZcUFcI5VRg,I've noticed that this property is typically priced much lower than other Hamptons in the KC area.  The pricing does reflect the refinement of the accomodations and the neighborhood. Small and older.  My room was clean.  However the bed was old.  Very small counter space for the bathroom.  Low water pressure in the shower.  No fitness room on the property but there is access to a gym about a mile and a half down the road.  (That gym felt a bit grungy and seemed to have old equipment - though they did have racquetball courts and reportedly a pool.)  I believe that the hotel also has a pool - though not likely very big.  Wifi was 'average' speed (my speed test showed about 0.3 Mbps for download). One cool thing in my room at least the electrical outlet on the desk (with 3 receptacle,3,0,6/27/2012,zKB3C4FXEUSZcUFcI5VRg,46,226,0

When we in the West were watching the civil unrest of the Arab Spring uprisings earlier this year never in our worst nightmares would we have imagined that a few months later less than a year to the London Olympics opening we would be witnessing consecutive nights of similar total anarchy on the streets of London which is spreading to other cities. Perhaps this is payback in some way for us being too smug about the recent chaos in countries like Greece and Syria. Perhaps the riots were born out of the frustration and anger at the perhaps dodgy circumstances surrounding the shooting of Mark Duggan last Thursday by the police.

You don't have to be a scientist just a person interested in learning something new or just brushing up on your basics. The lower level seems to contain some of the more historical exhibits but definitely make your way to the upper level where you can experience the technology and weather exhibits. The Science Storms (basic science and weather) exhibit is hands on exploratory and fascinating for all ages and even non-science types. You can see a 3-story tornado form an avalanche occur at different speeds a tidal wave form etc. This is the most impressive part. There are exhibits on the future with blend of science and technology. You can see what they are doing with textile,4,2,8/11/2011,e5VFAIWBHBL7PFMNArDg,46,307,1
PoTcSHUSHiChXKBVwCLtA,5FASUSCHFf3YotkKioZ5w,Good sandwiches here.  My favorites are the tandoori chicken with roasted red peppers and the sesame ginger chicken.  There was rampant confusion in the line when I was there last week with my sister Oona and her Orbit Gum guy fiance Harry.  They took orders in turn made sandwiches in turn and somehow we all still managed to get the sandwich of the person in front of  you in line - except me.  Kind of like when you button your shirt and you insert button #1 into buttonhole #2 and pretty soon you've got the asymetrical shirt look.  I thanked the guy behind me for holding my sandwich and we all had a ball - it was friendly downtown Oak Park after all. Did you know you and a friend or two can spend a cold Saturday huddled over a tiny fire and roast s'mores?!  Sweet lord I'm going tomorr,4,2,11/30/2005,5FASUSCHFf3YotkKioZ5w,662,1158,0

Good quality and hearty portions at a very fair price. The 3 of us made reservations for 8:30 and had a wait for about 10 minutes before we were seated. 1 server for this place of about 13 tables. All full. By 9:30 were were the only ones left and we could tell that the server wanted to leave. We were not rushed by any means but we could feel his anxiety to close for the night.

Even if it didn't change weekly they have enough variety on the menu to satisfy anyone's tastebuds. This past weekend I got the butternut squash soup with pork belly (OMG!) and apples.

If you're interested in doing dim sum make sure you tell the hostess so they seat you in the right area and bring you the right menu. I recommend getting there a little before the lunch rush on the weekends- you'll get seated on the side of the restaurant more frequented by the dim sum carts and will have more selection.

But then again it was pretty early and I don't think hipsters wake up until 10am. Enough of that though.....let's talk java!

I figured for the price you paid that it looked like a decent amount of food. I ordered a burger (which came with fries) and my husband ordered a hot dog. Our total meal came to about $20 with 2 sodas as well (refillable). The burger came with a sesame bun which was a nice change from a sad bun that had nothing on it.

I love their cucumber mojito (my fave by far) and you can't go wrong with the chowder. It truly is the best I've had.

QalYdswtOPmApsPm14ug,I7YQFiIsO82eliq8nqsLfA,Ok I think this place is GENIUS.    If you hate getting your bathroom dirty washing your dog but don't want to pay for a groomer hit this place up... you basically rent space to wash and dry your pooch!   Last time I was here it was relatively clean the prices were really reasonable and while they do sell things like shampoo and fancy soaps you can bring your own if you are on a budget.  I also liked that they have dryers as well as tubs for washing... noone likes a wet dog getting back in their car. For a place that deals in wet dogs it smelled ok to me... I hesitate to bring my dogs here only because sometimes they get too excited by other dogs and I don't want it to turn into a romp and roll... but the dogs I saw when I was there were calm and ranged from tiny (like you could w,4,4,7/13/2010,I7YQFiIsO82eliq8nqsLfA,192,523,0

Another thing to try is their nacatamales (nicaraguan tamales). Not to be passed up. But the best item is their cuban sandwich. Their cuban sandwich is made perfectly. I love cuban sandwiches and am always on the prowl looking for great cuban sandwiches (as well as gumbo). A cuban sandwich is basically a ham and cheese sandwich lol. What makes it so much better than a regular ham and cheese sandwich is the roasted pork. Add pickles too and you're all set. The cuban bread is then flattened with a press and toasted and you end up with a sandwich that is thin hot crispy and oozing delicious melted cheese!!

Anytime I've been they are super quick with making your food right in front of you and although there is usually a line it moves pretty quick.

Usually greasy and not very appetizing. Also they are overcooked. The service is spotty but the beers are cold. I am really not getting all the hype about this place.

They have made a few changes to help with the overflow. They shortened the deli and now offer prepackaged meals and many deli items that you would have to previously stand in line to order such as olives and feta cheese. They also reorganized and moved some things around. I don't see much difference this makes but who knows. All I know that it is very busy and that this store moves product and people at a pretty good clip. Produce is nearly farm fresh and always being stocked (except Sundays late PM as they do run out  so come early). Shelves are always full and or being restocked. They never run out of sale items.

Rf1sH66mG1Jjjrzwraulg,FAxFj4HQChpKxF6KL0rMnA,Not a review for the store although the home furnishings are great for small apartments and have cool designs. No this is for the food. I came to IKEA on Sunday for the food only. I needed to buy some new suits at the Mall of America. and I'm not impressed with the food court at MOA so I had lunch at IKEA. It's not great but it's so cheap you can't really complain. I had the Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes and lingdonberry sauce. It's 4.99 and you get a dozen meatballs. Lorae had the the buffalo chicken wrap for 3.99. Neither meal was great but it's worth a stop if you are out there shopping anyways. I'd say better than Panda Express. They don't rip you off on the beverages either Coffee is .99 and Soda is $1.29 with free refills. Downstairs you can get hot dogs for .50 a pi,3,5,7/27/2009,FAxFj4HQChpKxF6KL0rMnA,87,485,0

Anytime I meet someone from outside KC The Union ranks high on my list of recommended places to hang out.  As the many other reviews have already stated there are multiple sections to this bar/club. I will focus on my favorite parts the inside and outside dance areas. Since I consider myself the undiscovered Lady Gaga I know and love a good dance floor when I see one.  Unfortunately occasionally the inside bar will have a band (often terrible with only the band mates' girlfriends and parents in attendance) which sorta puts a whole damper on the inside vibe of the place.  But this is rare and only docks the pointage a little bit for the inside. The bar on the inside is always stinkin' packed at least 3 people deep.  That can get a little bit annoyin,4,0,1/2/2012,iRy197kaQ3xuQKkN5nksQ,12,61,0

A few months ago I realized my boyfriend (who grew up in so cal) had never been to Balboa or on the ferry. We drove to balboa peninsula walked around the fun zone (that Ferris wheel sure seemed bigger as a kid) and then took the ferry across to the Island to walk around. It feels very East coast beach townish. The ferry is clean and fast they always have them running so you don't have to wait very long and you can either drive on or walk on. The walk on is $1 per person each way which is CHEAP! If you are looking for a fun cheap thing to do I would say definitely go check this out!,5,4,7/6/2012,0GvJHXKM6p03hfDNLI46Q,3,105,0
RyUpqxHrNWwT9GHuhqw3w,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,* U-pick joy * This review is inspired by the U-pick thread that just recently started (http://www.yelp.ca/topic…) which reminded me of this wonderful place that I haven't visited since last summer.   We spent a good 3 hours picking the juiciest sweetest raspberries I have had for a LONG time.  It was amazingly fun (and rewarding!).  The fields are really well manicured so there is plenty of room to move between the rows and pick to your heart's content.  Sadly not organic but I am willing to overlook this once in a while! We picked 2 huge buckets of raspberries and I remember being pleasantly surprised by how little it cost when we weighed and paid at the end.   We made all sorts of raspberry treats for the next few weeks: First few days ------------------- - fresh raspberry pie - fresh ,4,12,7/2/2009,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,0
rYVk3OTrANXGMe07zCfKQ,KYtrBLCp1CudlGC1XiiSA,My previous life required that I spent a lot of time at airports not because I was traveling through them but I was actually running operations in them thus this gave a whole different insight as to how things work behind the scenes. It also allows me a certain understanding of the efforts and logistical work that it takes to handle all those passengers operations and challenges. DFW has gotten its act together despite the fact that AA pretty much runs this airport this place is run quite well. Passenger services such a food information and entertainment are adequate to the size and magnitude of this airport. It is easy to understand and move around.,4,4,4/20/2010,KYtrBLCp1CudlGC1XiiSA,174,1022,1

I don't go to this location enough to know how effective it is but it was interesting to me to be able to view and look down on the weights area. 2 floors weights on the bottom a loft type second floor with all the cardio machines placed around the open area border and class rooms there too. The cardio machines are pretty jam packed in there. It looked difficult to get to some of them since there wasn't much walk way. Also random but in the women's locker room the toilets are in their own little area which you have to go through a glass door to get to.

This place is a treat for locals and tourists alike. I've been here with friends who were born and raised in the area and I've brought my parents here the first time they visited; everyone will enjoy this place! What is especially great is that there is outdoor seating as well as a non-smoking section (a rarity for Newport!) which could be why I see more children here than any other restaurant on or near the Levee. In the outdoor area there is a smaller bar lots and lots of tables and two cornhole sets for patrons to use.

SUFI5LQ5PuqBmn5Fg,qmjoMFMZdLH696eGTGDZw,I have to totally agree with the first reviewer here. This Subway is awful! The woman working behind the counter has such limited English speaking ability it is difficult to communicate. And she WILL argue with you so beware. I had a breakfast sandwich and I have had them before at other locations but this one was terrible. She didn't heat the bacon so when she added it to the overcooked hot eggs it got soggy and slimy and gross!! I couldn't eat the slimy bacon so I took it off the sandwich and just ate the egg cheese and tomato. I wanted some sugar for my coffee and she pointed to where it is supposed to be and I didn't see it so I told her it wasn't there. She told me it was there and came out from behind the counter and pointed at the sugar substitute. I told her that wasn't sugar and ,1,3,4/9/2010,qmjoMFMZdLH696eGTGDZw,48,155,0

We did not have reservations and we were told it would be an hour wait. Since the bar was in front of us and I was expecting as much we had no problem with it. The place was tastefully decorated and had a rich feel from the moment you hit the front door. We sat at the bar and were asked for our drink order immediately. The drinks were a bit heavy handed as the Grey Goose Cosmo had fumes coming off of it. After about 10 minutes the hostess asked if we would like to sit in the bar as there were 3 boothes that were open seating. We had already ordered an appetizer and we were fine right where we were!

Next time I'll have the infamous burgers. Basically you couldn't go wrong with a single dish here. And for dessert: The molten lava cake was nothing special but still yummy enough to overindulge.

I usually drop my car off the moment they open at 7:30 (though they do allow early-bird drop off) for scheduled maintenance and it is ready in about 2 hours. One of the elements of Kerry Toyota that I love is their e-mail and text message reminders.

Like Candice said I never really venture past the Starbucks Women's clothing and dollar section right at the front.  The women's section is never very organized.  I also agree with Candice that the clearance items are usually older and marked higher than other Targets.

There are other pieces that include a baseball field and a skate park.   Cactus Wren Park offers a  spectacular vista of the Las Vegas Strip. Especially a few feet away from the dog park on the adjacent St. Rose Parkway pedestrian bridge where I went on a picture taking binge.   I love hiking trails (when it is not 100 degrees). Cactus Wren Park is one jewel of many scattered throughout  the CHTS. Because Cactus Wren Park is contiguous to the CHTS I am a fan.

It's great for kids of course as any zoo can be.

Once that ceiling has been reached the only way to make it more noteworthy is to provide fantastic origin stories about how organic it is. The mole was *wonderful* but was it more wonderful than the best I've had elsewhere for far far less? Not really. The carnitas were excellent. But were they better than the best I've had in Baja Mexico? No but they were pretty darn c,3,2,2/27/2012,ySXNLiIspI4UC8Qn7xT3w,34,199,0

Most of the cardio equipment is embarrassingly outdated. I'm sure the machines were top of the line in the 1980's but certainly not now. If you don't mind old equipment I guess you'd be happy here; there are certainly lots of treadmills stationary bikes ellipticals for you to use.

Looking for not too big a meal as I was eating at Alinea later that evening I spied a line of people waiting for food at Harold's Chicken Shack - that meant good food to attract the locals and food made to order. What sealed the deal though was when I spied gizzards on the menu - a delicacy to the Chinese and hard to find. When I asked the lady behind the counter whether this was southern style chicken she told me that they can make good fried chicken in the north too and she was going to prove it to me!

Is there a better way to forget the flurry and worry of the work week and the blistering cold outside than surrounded by a group of friendly happy yelpers full of hummus free liquor and with unlimited access to a microphone and tome of karaoke songs? Who knew such musical talent lived in so many. Happy Festivus to everyone - and many thanks to Tara for such a fabulous event!,5,2,12/9/2010,KMue1c95XeKgrdMeGS0A,86,413,0

TGCzX4bbuwjoyPwMOeRZw,1h1DD2hgfgud7V4NCE9mVg,I have no complaints about this place as it was the only butcher open after 6 on a w/end. Parking is at a premium of course and the selection of meats didn't seem huge. Prices seemed about average and our butcher was pleasant enough. We purchased ground turkey for our healthier In-N-Outs and it was pretty good when not trying to compare it to beef of course. As a local though I must say I rediscovered this part of Robson as a mini-Korean-Japan. Even this mall reminded me of such. Am I right? It was actually quite convenient to pick up veggies here too and the place was nearly empty. So I would return here again especially in a pinch.,3,5,5/17/2012,1h1DD2hgfgud7V4NCE9mVg,36,420,0

Hilarity: our server asked one of the black-bean burger orderers how she would like it cooked.  Is there an appropriate answer to this ques,2,0,1/2/2011,tnB38eHbeFuabXBdJMwvg,23,141,0

TKFsqsvkpaKk7XfVbAgnw,IjD4OCS3lHlVtgJeLsWyiQ,We used a Living Social voucher for our one night stay. We had a couple issues getting here it was hard to find while driving since the sign for the hotel is at the top of the building and not by the awning outside. We also weren't sure which parking garage to park in for our parking to be validated. We could have had our car valet  but the valet spot in front was small and taken up by taxi's. We just drove around and pulled our car into the garage ourselves. The lobby is small but nice looking.  The diner was closed each time we came by the front desk. There is a bar right there and it was warm and inviting.  All the staff we encountered were friendly. The standard room is just that standard. The room was tiny no coffee pot and certainly not as clean as I would have expected it to be. ,4,1,1/6/2012,IjD4OCS3lHlVtgJeLsWyiQ,3,18,0

Even if you had to pay the fourty bucks for dinner the 2 block long buffet of food would have been worth it. I had the prime rib and the end cut was not over done. The shrimp by the boat load. The sauce was a little heavy on the horseradish which made it real tangy. The salmon had a good taste to it. The roasted chicken was very moist. The breaded pork chop w/the bone was my favorite. Lite seasoning and juicy. Sorry I didn't touch the veggie's the hole time I was there. The deserts are ok. Nothing to write home about. They were fresh though.

TMXqk8nHP40uK8Ir1fPxA,FZTkBavnUWVQRK3ULOxePQ,On the Free Porch it's pretty simple.   Everything is free.   This has been just like this for the last 3-4 years that we have seen.   Not sure who owns the building or what it used to be but if you see something you need it's yours.   And by all means if you have something you don't want and think someone else can use it do leave it.   We have found this as a great place to leave some cloths and other things that we don't need and they do seem to disappear.   So if you are headed to the Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site and Park  here's something to take a look at right before the park entrance. As the signs state just don't leave trash.   And no animals.   In particular no kittens please. It's right next door to the Post Office.,5,3,5/10/2009,FZTkBavnUWVQRK3ULOxePQ,938,1749,0

TNPjslKBeIjcbGeUCJhxA,J6jxfCx8p6VSOV5QvtH7Pw,I'd have given this restaurant 5 stars if I was just judging service. As it is I'm also critiquing the food which only ranks at a 4 star. I'd been wanting to try this place for a while so when a vendor offered to take us here for happy hour I couldn't resist going even if I had to enjoy it with coworkers (versus friends) The Reuben rolls were surprisingly good. Think spring roll meets Reuben sandwich ingredients. Instead of sweet chili sauce on the side you get 1000 island dressing. This was good albeit deep fried and more fattening than if you got it on rye. The fried sliders were disappointing. They look like crispy chicken sandwiches but are actually cooked hamburger patties dipped in batter and deep fried then served on a bun.

Btw I love Thorton Park its my home away from home.    This location is an open room floor plan with the bar in the center of the restaurant.  Only about half the size of the Winter Park Dexters but just as nice.  Decor meets the needs of the surrounding area businesses trendy spacious and the windows up front are big enough to view anything going on in the streets.  Outdoor seating is great due to the ambiance of Thorton park but sitting inside was for me last night.  Looking over the menu you will see combinations and meals that you won't find in the area.,4,0,6/2/2011,T4LT4dPTTTVZocPhwrJboQ,7,130,1

This train station is in my top 5 train stations in the world.  After spending some time in the train stations over in Europe this place is absolute top notch.  The station is clean there are so many things inside of it from little shops to food choices as well as signs to get you from point A to B. Even if you're in NYC and don't need to hop on a subway you need to drop by here and see just how grand this place is.  The ceiling is fantastic and even though this place is always busy it's never got to a point were I couldn't walk and felt claustrophobic.,5,0,12/27/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJtg,157,605,1

I was in need of some caffeine later in the evening when all coffee shops were closed so we figured this would be the best alternative before going to the hookah that's next door. First thing we asked was about caffeine and the cashier right away started asking if I wanted hot or cold etc. I am lactose intolerant so that narrowed some stuff down. We stopped on the cold French vanilla smoothie with tapioca. That was an amazing choice! It was smooth creamy not too watery but not too chunky and the tapioca was just right. Only thing was that I somehow managed to make a tiny crack at the top of the cup that kept dripping slightly when it was still full but that may have been due to my own misuse of the cup :).

Shazam and Soundhound couldn't identify the song. Picking through the Flash code on the site with a handful of my favourite developers was useless. I emailed the web designer and got no response.

This place is the perfect combination of simple styling cool atmosphere and not pretentious at all. There is plenty of room to stand around and gather with friends and meet new ones. The lighting is perfectly low. The bartenders know their stuff and they are quick. They even have room outside to hang out which looked cool but no one was outside because it was way too cold but I really want to hit the outside when the weather is much warmer. The stage and music was a pleasant surprise. I will go back for sure!!,5,4,1/23/2011,1gEx8Si6rkStWBpIXnGCw,65,459,0

On a Saturday afternoon we decided to go down to see how the food tasted when we aren't  post paryting and drunk.  Against all the rave reviews I must say that unless its late and the only thing open then yes its a great option otherwise I am just not that impressed. My Lulo juice had sugar granules on the bottom my juice was not only too sweet but crunchy.  I like crunchy - but not when its my juice. The empanadas were tiny.  Good but tiny.  The salsa picante was all liquid no salsa.  Its supposed to be chunky not liquid.

Yea. That may have happened with Mai and me. Jaws may be dropping in shock as my initial review of Mai didn't leave much hope for reconciliation but this broad knows when to admit when she's wrong. (sometimes) Since my last review I actually made my way back to Mai a few times that have included a birthday party post Nashville Fashion Week celebration and to hang out after a jam-packed evening of events.

Firstly it is square and secondly it's got a park in the middle of it. Leicester Square will always have a special place in my psyche as my sister and I knew it for years before we came to England through playing Monopoly. We were however rather upset to find out that it wan't pronounced 'Lay-ses-ter' square but instead 'Les-ter' square. Go figure. Leicester Square is a good focus for the West End. The cinemas on the square no longer hold the same special place as films now go on general release around the country on the same day rather than starting in the West End as they used to.

The design here is bright without feeling overly cartoon-ish. I like the silhouettes of wildlife downstairs the white branch candle-holders and the long skinny fireplace and comfy couches. Free wine hour is a nice extra perk too even if I didn't get to take advantage. Laura L is right that staying on a higher floor is advisable,5,1,6/11/2010,0zRLjgw0PQUwqiUCOIgShQ,85,530,1

Go to the store to make sure it will work for you.  This happens to be the only one in Miami actually!  I found an amazing bustier online that would look super cute with jeans and happily ran over to the store to see how it would look on ,3,3,5/19/2009,Ai7ZSET9dbLh1qUdcyC5Q,316,1146,0
UunO6wOSrWgGv6wV3Qjsg,wB8ATiDKotKsPjEPJgwtw,Went here the today in search for a chair and chaise lounge for the new house. While they have really great selection of nice chairs at decent prices I was very disappointed to find out they don't carry any chaise lounges in the store. I knew they were not super popular but when your store is that huge I can't believe you have a total of zero available. I do like the no interest financing deals they offer which make the purchase of a bunch of stuff not nearly as painful when you can spread it out at no cost.,3,0,12/26/2010,wB8ATiDKotKsPjEPJgwtw,58,629,1

UUx3SOl41cZakdtBd9yKA,V6yxlGOfbFtXYQxxRLd0g,SERVICE: Pool Closing and Opening I dislike writing these kind of review but when enough is enough! We decided last year to use Trevi to close our pool. The service was so so. I can not remember the details but when they called to open it this year my mother had hesitations and gave them her feedbacks from last year's but yet decided to give them a second chance. Well it it was the last! These are no professional pool people. They are simple guys that thy hire for their strength that know nothing about pools. Let me explain: 1-When they came to take of the net and delivered the salt they left the net all rolled-up on the grass and it was up to us to wash it let it dry and fold it. Do you know how heavy a net is? Then they left the 10 bags of salts on our ground for us to put away. Oh,1,3,4/28/2012,V6yxlGOfbFtXYQxxRLd0g,36,54,0

If I hadn't already been to Orange Leaf I may have been more blown away... but as the case was it's exactly what I expected. Self-serve frozen yogurt and toppings that you pay for by weight. And while that description sounds like I was underwhelmed it doesn't mean I wasn't pleased. I do love frozen yogurt... and RM offered plenty of fresh and fruity topping options to go with it: watermelon kiwi mandarin oranges and (yes) even mango. So as I sat indoors during a sweltering summer day reading about the wonders of their all-natural nonfat probiotic gluten-free kosher froyo yes I was impressed just not amazed.,4,2,7/13/2011,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0

We waited in line for about 15 minutes which is I guess an extremely short wait for them usually its over half an hour! We ended up getting a Chocolate mouse one and Amaretto to try later and both were AMAZING!! I ended up coming here before I had to fly back to Chicago stood in line and purchased 8 cannolis that flew back to Chicago with me for my family!! Part of the 8: Plain Ricotta Cheese: plain and simple and gooood Pistachio: it was great but not amazing the pistachios werent salty they were just... there and didnt add to the flavor Chocolate Moussse: num num nuuuum chocolate lovers Espresso: the outside was a bit bitter but overall not bad Amaretto: veeeery sweet but veeeery good,5,0,4/12/2012,Wj5GZi04C6MOqOkTbKY4tA,12,136,1

I went in feeling like we would have a unpleasant ride as we got DIRT CHEAP tickets and Iberia's website and 1-800 customer service SUCKS. We actually had a very very nice ride over the pond in style. The food was actually decent. They gave us little slippers to put on our feet and pillows and blankets for us all that were neatly folded and clean. We had a layover in Madrid. The Madrid airporto SUCKS BIG TIME and I will give a a 0 star review when Yelp goes international. Anyways Iberia was a pleasant surprise. HELLO!!! FREE ALCOHOL!!  Great Spanish beer and vino. I have to say they run a gracious transatlantic transportation service.

I stayed here a few years ago for a Lexus branding luxury summit event for 2 days when I was on contract and working for Lexus HQ. The event included speakers and presentations from Lexus Four Seasons Nordstrom Apple and Starbucks with well know branding/marketing writers like Marcus Buckingham. It was put on primarily for Lexus dealers from the Central/Mid West region. It was one of the most interesting business marketing events I've been to. Part of the itinerary was to tour the employee only areas of the hotel. I can't tell you how impeccable the kitchen laundry rooms and how everything is run so methodical and efficient behind the scenes.

Frock was the first place in Toronto (as far as I know anyway) to sell Matt & Nat bags and purses. Back in the day (ie 2005) it was suuuuper impossible to find Matt & Nat in the city but Frock delivered the goods. I've purchased many a wallet at this store. They also stock really cool and quirky accessories jewellery shoes and outerwear. The displays and layout of the store are really charming and well thought out and the owner is incredibly nice and friendly!

uZOrYEwBOQNAl2CyegVg,I7YQFiIsO82eliq8nqsLfA,I love this place- it's good simple food cooked well for reasonable prices. I was there tonight and my friends and I split the mussels as an appetizer (they are listed on the menu as an entree but the size was just right for three people as an appetizer) and then I had the lamb shank with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  It was AMAZING- perfectly cooked so it was flavorful and the meat was falling off the bone.  It didn't taste lamby like lamb can sometimes taste and it was mouthwatering.  Loved it. For dessert my friends and I split the apple crumble and it was also the perfect size for three people- large and fresh it was like an Entenmen's coffee cake only with apples and fresh ice cream on top.  HEAVENLY. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars from me was because of the servi,4,1,9/16/2010,I7YQFiIsO82eliq8nqsLfA,192,523,1
uZt8UgrK61gMt75zEBPJQ,aomkMAGFrLgD6cqQjB4bw,Don't let the name confuse you - it's not a restaurant... not really.  In my book it's more a Taiwanese cafe/bubble tea joint that serves food.  Apparently there's two other locations under different names - one being Beefy Beef on Main and I forgot the name of the other place. I've been here a few times (since my friends like this place) and have yet to try their food (and I'm not going to count condensed milk toast).  But it's a pretty good spot to grab $4.50-ish milk tea or a smoothie - it's off the main Kingsway strip and tucked away the place is small and pretty chill.

The food is good portions large and service is accommodating. They have your typical Italian menu but some nice American choices also. Specials are always available and these include baby octopus (which I actually recommend- it is tender and tasty) as well as a host of fish and pasta dishes. One of the things that has earned my parents love is the rib special. For 9.95 Mon- Thursday you can get a full slab of ribs. My dad loves them. The dining area feels upscale- but is not reflected in the prices. They have a nice bar area that can be used if you have to wait for a table as well as FREE PARKING!

I am giving it 4 stars for professionalism but I would have given it 5 had they been good about bringing extra bread for when we ordered soups and salads. I give them props for bringing fresh rolls that were hot. I am also impressed with how clean the restaurant was and how friendly the waitstaff was.

I don't know his name but the owner of JM Curley has made both of my visits so amazingly pleasant that I would call the experience there a remedy for a bad day. Seriously it is that wonderful. The establishment itself is quaint and cute the decor is fun and although it seems like there is very little seating I've yet to wait more than 2 minutes for a table. If all you want are drinks they've got 'em. The bar is well-stocked and if the bartender doesn't see you the fantastic owner himself will come to you hand you a drink menu and ask if you've been helped yet. The food is damn good as well.

I popped in here to get a birthday present for a friend and in a special promotion I received some free samples of their products. Now I have to confess to being a very un-reconstructed man when it comes to grooming products for men. However the nice smells emanating from the freebies tempted me to use one of their bath bombs and I have to admit that it was lovely! So Lush products are about as metrosexual as I'm going to get but I have to confess that they are nice to use. By the way they're also quite funky - my friend rung me to thank me and asked where I had got the inspiration to use popcorn instead of foam padding inside the gift box!,4,12,8/10/2009,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,754,1693,0

Summit books all kinds of places around Keystone and was super helpful. Actually they were the first response to a number of VRBO inquiries I sent out and called me back on a Sunday.

In fact if you're even within walking distance of the Distillery District you'll hear people talking about how a trip there isn't complete without a visit to Soma.

The significant other and I popped in for dinner tonight and from the moment we sat down it was a thoroughly pleasant experience. The majority of the food at Sama Zama is geared towards small plates. We opted to sample the garlic infused asparagus and it was fantastic. There were a ton of options ranging from the standards like miso soup and edamame to some pretty unique options like a shrimp asparagus calamari concoction served in a spicy sauce with lettuce wraps. It looked tasty and he confirmed. I will DEFINITELY be back here soon to sample more of the small plates but a lot of them are meat heavy and I want to wait until I'm back on the flesh before doing that experience. So for my full meal I ordered yaki udon w/ vegetables. The udon noodles ,4,8,2/1/2012,f1MFQxTZAWJnRQdrouLgA,56,409,0

It's a mixed crowd most of the time and there are themed nights during the week as well.  Unless things have changed I believe Wednesdays are underwear night and Thursdays and Bear Night.  Not everyone participates in these and you certainly aren't pressured to do so either unless it's by your own friends.

After we ordered...it took about 15 minutes to get our appetizer (which was basically goat cheese slightly toasted on a bed of greens) and another 20 minutes for our salads. I ordered a green salad with chicken (pretty much lettuce cucumbers onions and a breast of chicken) and my boyfriend ordered the italian tuna salad (tuna salad next to some greens). Pretty long wait for such simple choices huh? We thought so. Our food was good but due to the slow service...not sure if I'll be going back anytime soon.

We had late reservations and ate upstairs so by 9:30 we were the only people in the dining room.  That made it seem kind of cozy as it was a little loud when there were more people in the room. Service all around was great.  Our waiter addressed our needs and the bread girls were awesome at providing us with that terrific bread. The food was delicious from start to finish.  The bread was wonderful.  Cheddar bread sourdough and rum raisin were all so good it was hard not to fill up on bread! Clam chowder was rich and filling.  The kumato tomato and burrata salad was a unique twist on the standard tomato and mozzarella and I would highly recommend it.

I am not a big fan of the atmosphere at Cozy...it's all wooden...these days you are sometimes the only table in the whole bar...and it's just all blah to me. I don't mind going here with friends though to get our drink on as they love the place. I think they like having the whole place to themselves. Never had a problem with the flavored soju...regular soju and mixed soju prices are standard although their beer prices are apparently slightly less compared to other Korean bars. The one thing I admittedly love about Cozy is the nohraebang (karaoke rooms) in the back. Nothing tops a night of drinking soju then belting out (or in my case dropping some sick lines from :P) your favorite song! Cozy will definitely always be ,2,3,9/4/2010,QnIrewrXxFnsswgG1gFQ,76,738,0

On weekends it gets pretty chaotic because there are usually multiple events going on upstairs in the lounge and on the patio and people are milling between the venues when they only have access to one so security can be a bit of a pain and the washrooms (shared with the first floor and basement) can get crowded. It's best to stay put. There are cute guys fun dancers lots of places to sit down and relax two bars and decent sound.

However I wouldn't shop here.  I saw a pair of UGG boots for $60 and a pair of sunglasses for $6 that looked scratched up.  I'd have to be a label whore to shop here.,3,0,10/15/2012,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7zkmjg,4,131,0
WQPRFKnC4vHtNAUFAARTg,AX6TWJtUn0UXKROrR7ZdAw,Rented a Tux here recently and it seemed to start out fine. Was promptly greeted upon arrival and measured - some sticker shock when I received the bill of over $190 for a Tux rental. Several days later picked up the Tux only to find out they screwed up the order. OK pay $190 to rent a Tux and it better be correct. I ended up wearing the Tux - which was fine but wore one of my own dress shirts. I think I would have been OK with their screw up if they would have reduced the bill to compensate me for the hassle and for me wearing my own shirt - but they refused and still charged me for everything. Or how about a coupon for $x amount off my next visit - but no. Next time I will go somewhere else.,1,1,3/12/2011,AX6TWJtUn0UXKROrR7ZdAw,133,287,0
wR57dKqSpdpdNQ7j1s0Q,bcTU9jRBOxWck4WApiC1tQ,Fast Food! We recently stopped in for a quick lunch before a game since it was on the way. The bar had a decent amount of people in it the patio was packed but the restaurant was sparsely populated. By sparsely I mean just us. After we sat down I realized why - IT WAS HOT!!!! Even the waitress asked us if we thought it was hot. I hate being hot so this wasn't the best place for me but we lived. I had a Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich with cottage cheese. It was decent. Dining companion had Reuben and chips. He said it was pretty good. The chips were store bought generic that didn't appeal to me. Bill was around $20 for lunch so a decent price.   Service and food were both quick.

On Thanksgiving day I was living that commercial but with a lot more profanity. It started as a small 3 inch crack and I was ready to call Safelite for a repair. By the time I got home it grew to 12 inches. So now I'm in the hole for a new windshield. Well the procrastinator in me decided to put it off because hell it was in the passenger side. That was until all of sudden a huge circle shape appeared in my driver side. Now fearing that if something hit the window they could be picking a huge circle shape of windshield out of my body.

So the story goes: I plan and schedule my hair appointments far in advance so that I can respectively give the hair stylist timely notice; about a month out. For this appointment it was important-- it was my graduation from my Master's program at TAMU. My hair needed to be right! Even thought I did as I always do above when scheduling with a hair stylist my original hair stylist did not have me scheduled in her planner on the day I was suppose to go in even though I had confirmed a week prior. Freaking out I called every African-american female I knew to be referred to a African -american hair care stylist. I was referred to Etta at Sybling by a co-worker.

I agree service is not top notch.  They are always friendly and in good moods though. Be careful when ordering and make sure your order is understood.  We haven't had anything taken to the moon from a misunderstanding but they are evident.  For the first time recently I ordered something other than a beer or margarita. I asked for a mixed drink (jack and coke) and the server had to wait for another one to help talk her through making it.

It's because I'd go in for an oil change and they would recommend all kinds of other stuff that would set me back $80. I refuse to go there anymore. I go to Sears Auto Center because I get free tire rotations (my tires are under warranty through them). I drove up to the closed door of the bay and waited a few minutes for the door to open. I exited my car and walked around the building to the store part. There was nobody there. A man came out from the back and offered to help me. He ushered me to the garage where they finally opened the door and let me drive in. I stood awkwardly in the garage outside of my car while one mechanic typed my phone number into the computer and another mechanic attached large clamps to the outsides of my tire,1,13,1/12/2012,MI3wG3R12sQuTGdNvBBX3A,20,313,0

The structure marble and monument itself is drop-dead gorgeous. You just walk inside and feel tiny while knowing you're experiencing a critical part of American history and importance. Talk about making you feel proud. Then you turn around and realize you have a phenomenal view of the Washington monument DC and the water. Could you really ask for me? Oh well if you can here are a few other perks: 1) It's free 2) It's epic 3) No lines 4) No vendors hanging around trying to poach business with expensive souvenirs (there's one booth at the entrance that's it) 5) It's beautiful 6) Did I mention it's free and well just important to experience at least twice in your life,5,5,10/13/2012,NfU0zDaTMEQ4X9dbQWd9A,76,440,0

XLz8PWpPpliaIrQFOnzQ,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,This Costco location is in the Shoreline district right on the border of the Edmonds area. It is my favorite one even though the 'downtown' Seattle location may be a little closer as the parking lot seems easier to navigate and the gas station a little easier to get out of as well. The store itself is pretty clean although the layout of each Costco seems to be just a tad bit different from the others. This one has the paper products in the back of the store and a coffee grinder at the front of the store by the food court. You can't go wrong with some of the deals but be weary of the meat department as not all things are 'deals' just because you bought them in bulk. My husband & I can't possibly finish 6 lbs of hamburger meat or 'need' that much! The food court is always great for a pizza s,4,0,1/3/2012,jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw,68,519,0

XOWjjw8KGNrRb0GSIZnPQ,pigX6LYBwjoMzEQhWzKOA,Dave Magrogan and Dana Farrell have collaborated to create an intriguing new restaurant format focused on a few simple concepts: 1) local sustainable ingredients 2) sensible food preparation to keep the calorie count down and 3) a well-appointed list of wines to pair with the exquisite food. Set in an old Gap location in a suburban strip mall Harvest is a welcome introduction to a community populated by chain restaurant options. Don't come to Harvest expecting fried foods or dishes cooked in butter. If you're looking for a menu created on locally-produced and sustainable items most often grilled then Harvest is the place for you.

XpQ2OnxRRoBT8hAYZ19TA,9VDrCkfj0IMDSDPgsPKFA,Momofuku Ko is one of the only restaurants I have ever heard of where lunch is a bigger deal than dinner. They only serve it on Fri-Sat-Sun and it's significantly longer with a bunch of extra courses compared to dinner. On a recent visit to NYC my wife and I had our first Michelin 2 star lunch at Momofuko Ko. I have truly never been anywhere quite like this place (including Atera). The restaurant is basically a tiny nondescript bar. It's very each to miss because it looks like a grated-up business from the outside. Only a tiny peach (and our Apple Maps) gave us a clue that we were in the right place. When you open the door it's amazing how tiny it is inside. There's only 12 seats all around a bar.

The waiter came over and  apologized for the hair. However it took forever to get the new burger and once we recieved the bill it was still on there.

I drank the Bouchard pinot noir ($8/glass) which wasn't too shabby and ate the goat cheese. I think I would prefer the goat cheese to be served with crackers (which I ended up requesting) instead of the garlic bread. The garlic bread is so delicious that it doesn't need to be tainted with other flavors. One thing I noticed is that service was lacking at the area of the bar where there was no cash register.

The Bulls know how to put on a party with games and fun and attractions.  Little kids beating mascots in running races t-shirt guns etc.  It's like Minor League Hockey but without small children wailing on each other between periods. Overall it's a lot of fun and relatively cheap too.,5,3,7/7/2011,HUmClClluKP5Ur6X7e306Q,128,900,0

It's really close to my fella's work and some of his coworkers were getting together there so I was game.  Most of food they serve here just doesn't do anything for me. It's all about sheer quantity --there's no subtlety to Damon's. But it is what it is. The company was great and you really can't complain about the prices.  My friend and I were going to get cokes but once we were informed that margaritas were only $2.50 we changed our game plan. Man was that a pucker of a margarita though -- it was almost like they'd poured any salt that should be on the rim right into the cup.

I like it because the staff has always been really friendly to me especially during checkout. No one tries to bother you while you are shopping either. TJ Maxx has a great selection of...just about everything. This is the first TJ Maxx that I've seen that has hair products at it as well from shampoo to conditioner and hair styling tools- mostly straighteners. Their home decor department does seem a bit sparse and homely at times but they have a great purse and clothing selection. I always come here when I want to get a nice purse at a good price.

This is a pet friendly property.  Since I cannot travel with my dog when on business I so enjoy seeing other guests pets whenI stay here.  AND there is a wine reception everyday where many guest come to enjoy a nice glass of complimentary wine and bring their dogs for all to enjoy.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE  this place and would recommend it to anyone,5,0,2/14/2011,C4WDUp194bqDIlWxgRC8uw,0,2,1

Service can't find problems that other dealerships can replicate and fix.  I will miss the drive to Lake Bluff to see them - now I can just go and see the lake.

There are couches all over with little space to dance. Upstairs is more suited for private parties though both the times when we went upstairs it was a normal club scene. Both the floors have separate DJ's and they play different kinds of music. The place is very famous with Asians every time we walked there were Asians all around us(I like Asian girls !!!).

The only reason Jefferson Hall doesn't get one lonely star is because the live talent (although being too loud for the space) was very good. They played great music and I honestly would love to listen to them more... if the volume were just a teensie bit lower. I'm looking forward to Campbell county to have a smoking ban like Kenton county but I won't knock Jefferson Hall for the smokiness of the place. What I do blame them for is a pointless cover charge to stand around in a smoky venue and have your eardrums blown out. I'm not sure what they're trying to be.

It has a mom and pop feel to it and is great for a snack or inexpensive meal when you don't feel like dining from the mass of chain restaurants in the vicinity. The curries available are all out on display so you can point to the most promising looking dish. I can recommend the briyanis and lamb curries. There are onion bhakis and samosas for a quick takeaway snack. There is a small seating area and a little tip is that they show cricket from the sub continent and I've spent some happy times eating curry and watching cricket with the workers.

It's the best feature of the hotel - as the hotel itself is seriously dated in terms of it's condition HVAC systems and such. I ordered an omelet with Chorizo mushrooms spinach onions and cheese plus snagged some breakfast potatoes and a side of bacon from the buffet. The omelet was very good! I also liked the breakfast potatoes they had a nice crust on the outside and were soft and chewy on the inside. Bacon is of course bacon! Crisp and delicious without being underdone or overcooked.

Y6W8oI1BULsgOafBpCNg,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,I've coveted an iPad since the tablet was launched but could never bring myself to spend that amount of cash on this luxury. On my last trip to the USA I did pop into Apple shops in multiple cities and managed to walk out of each store though I was sorely tempted on more than one occasion However I did get hooked onto playing Sparkle in the shops - it's a brilliant version of Zuma and can quite quickly become addictive. Sadly this was the final factor in my decision to finally puchase the iPad. I was meeting one of my local Yelp friends at the Farmers market next to The Grove shopping centre in Los Angeles. So I arrived a bit early and popped in here. I consider the Apple shops to be the perfect retail experience where they['re confident enough to let the products speak for themselves ,5,20,6/13/2012,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,754,1693,0
YfVzkF3qHI3oZLfWZlRw,UXOe17qSHcGyP0ab8Abfg,My-oh-my have times changed for Irene's. It used to have a reputation for being a great hole in the wall with cheap delicious food. Since opening as a chain and having a bar it has changed. The food and service is just okay. Luckily the food is still addictive. I've been going here for years and saw a dramatic change in the food. My platanos were not all ripe the coleslaw was not slawed (for lack of a better word) and my pupusa was drenched in grease. All that being said it isn't the worst place and if you have never had a pupusa you should give it a try. Stick to the basics though.,3,2,2/20/2012,UXOe17qSHcGyP0ab8Abfg,8,115,0

My family (my husband me and three kids) went here for dinner on the Saturday before Valentine's day for a nice family meal.  I did make reservations beforehand for 6 o'clock because I didn't know if it was going to be crowded or not.  I am glad I did because this is one hopping place with good reason! Their menu is amazing--look online they have tons of different kinds of macaroni and cheese--how can you go wrong?!   I ordered the Chicken Caesar Panini with my side as a salad and everything was reeeeeally good.  Although the bread for the panini was more toasted than panini-like.  However it was all still very good!

I was so enthused that we made sure to park close to this place and just walked to the statue after. There are a few frozen yogurt and smoothie shops now opened in Northwest Suburbs but none that I have been to have that self-served station and weigh-in and they usually do not have much of a variety of froyo or toppings. I was hoping that this place will be like a real froyo place where you build your own tower of goodness. My expectations were all met :) this was not like another wannabe frozen yogurt shop from the suburbs. There were dispensers lined across a wall for self-served froyo.

Just be careful the ladies in liberal arts office can be testy and know what major you want before enrolling or they get you for 5 years somehow.  Also keep information about what the requirements were when you enrolled because they have a tendency to switch reqs and drop majors.

zr7Olga9lsKsuDhqOTLtA,FZTkBavnUWVQRK3ULOxePQ,Very close to Hensel Park and the botanical gardens of Texas A & M University this is a unique cafe that opened in 2005 which takes Model T Fords on display and combines them with English Afternoon tea from 2-5 PM along with fine beers and wines expresso and even pastries such as home made cheesecake.   The T Garden Cafe is owned and operated by Bryan native Jennifer Hardeman Lilleker. Jennifer has a culinary degree from The Culinary Institute of America in New York and a business degree from The University of Texas at Austin. Will report back with a food review once we have had a proper meal.  They are only open for lunch three hours a day Monday through Saturday from 11a-2p.    (Also available for private events in evenings).,5,0,2/17/2009,FZTkBavnUWVQRK3ULOxePQ,938,1749,0
ZrkRHUbbPVWLbpfTt5jw,K8jpilJCv962HKTVt7VsQ,I have stayed here twice and each visit was for a single night. I can't rate the service because other than checking in (which was fine) I didn't really need any service. Now some folks find it tacky to stay at a place that is largely covered by a glass domes or ceilings. For me I didn't care. I must say I certainly enjoyed walking around in shorts while it was snowing outside. The place is incredible... like in indoor city. The place is layed out to creat an outdoor world all while inside. There are many wonderlands inside such as the Magnolia the Delta and the Conservatory sections. All areas create lush outdoor environements full of plants trees rivers and waterfalls. There is even a boat ride the river in the Delta. The controlled environement allows plants and trees that we a,5,3,11/12/2010,K8jpilJCv962HKTVt7VsQ,125,323,1

The Tod Mun were crispy fried fish cakes served with an excellent vinegary cucumber relish.  The relish had just the right combination of sweetness sharpness and heat to cut through the richness of the fish cakes. The Citrus Beef was another example of the great balance of flavors that I love about Thai food. Sweet salty spicy rich and bitter all in the same bite.  What more can you ask for? We also ordered pork chicken and seafood curries.  They were all good but not at  the same level.

I usually like to pick up a case of beer at the CVS across the street and Nick's provides a bucket of ice. Nick's also has a concession stand. Their chicken sandwich is excellent and I usually order it with french fries. Staff is friendly and accommodating and there is plenty of parking in the lot out front.

I wish they'd stay open a little later on Saturdays because 5 is kinda early & you have to rush to see things.

Watkins Glenn doesn't offer too many establishments in the heart of the town for breakfast and unfortunately for us the only other family style restaurant was closed leaving the Savard the only option. The line was out the door not a problem and it was after 11:30am when we got to the hostess so breakfast was no longer an option still not a problem but what is a problem is the hostess and how she treated us the other customers and the staff.

Urbanite has a simple modern inside that definitely fits the bill. The plus is that they have original artwork on the walls and they rotate it and sell the art. So if you don't like what you see this week? No problem you might just walk away with something off the walls next week. Service totally stellar! Everyone from the hostess to the bartender to our super attentive and sweet server. We had a table of twelve not an easy feat and he handled it all with a huge smile and great attitude.

Their food was pretty good - consistent what-you-would-expect breakfast food. I liked that my omelette was full to the brim with goodies and not overly eggy. Nothing overly special but it's definitely tasty and I'll definitely be back! You can't beat the prices either. Better than Angelo's although it's just as busy if not busier at times.

They would just flat out ignore you since they were so flustered and couldnt handle the crowd.This is the best part they were refusing orders!

The rest of dim sum items you will need to order them off the menu. Everything we ordered were delicious. Chicken feet here have more kick to it (not literally) they just have more spices to it.

Our waiter brought us the drinks right away. When we ordered It took less than 10 minutes to get our salad and entrée. My salad was a bit wilted. Probably from being room temperature. My turkey panini was luke warm and the cheese looked old. That confused me as it came out so quickly. Was there an extra just sitting around? I had no ketchup for my fries and I didn't see the little boy who was serving us until we were finished.

I felt like I walked around more than necessary stuff seemed to be spread out in a way that didn't capitalize on the space between exhibits.   Overall I got a feeling of emptiness when I was there which isn't something you should get from a place teeming with animal life!

We got a quart of the vegetarian chili to take home which I had no intention of trying.  But come dinner time I took a peek and it smelled pretty good!  I gave it a try and once again....pleasantly surprised!  I actually liked!

VzcoDQ4ENu9r9c7AH3Nw,USZx55MA2lG2hBu6PWJA,What a great event! I had no idea before venturing into Albert Hall that the evening would be so much fun. It has the perfect setting for solving the Murder Mysteries which we all Yelpers experienced yesterday.The place is actually big with a separate area designated for private parties in the back. As soon as Yelpers got in the drama started unfolding for the rest of the evening. I must say all those people who were dressed as some characters like the old lady and gangster did a very good job. They made sure to involve all the yelpers in solving the murder mystery and I could see everybody was having a great time. This event also offered a nice opportunity to mingle with the fellow yelpers. Met some great yelpers right from Bobbi B. Margaret T Jia J and others. Hope to see you again at,5,3,9/22/2011,USZx55MA2lG2hBu6PWJA,29,559,0

Oh what changes in a year! Since that first review I have gone to every bout at the US Cellular arena and even caught a few All Star bouts at Franklin Sports Complex!. The bouts never get old!  They are full of action and I seem to always be on the edge of my seat.   I have never paid full price for a ticket.  There is always either a coupon or a chance to bring in food or school supplies to get a discounted price. Seating is general admission so I always get there when the doors open to claim a section for us.   Last night's half time show was the best (behind of course the Jazzy Jewels).  It wa,5,1,3/11/2012,hB5iwMFPVG3dM2zChrgrMw,53,241,0
wNdVIqkvUYuY9DHAm7Zw,MI3wG3R12sQuTGdNvBBX3A,I simply heart my Oak Park TJ's and did not think that any other could possibly compare. Au contraire! This Trader Joe's just opened in May 2011 (not being from this neighborhood we went back and forth about how long it'd been around). There are three points of significance about this location: 1) It has a FREE parking garage built into the store. Oh yeah! 2) It's SPACIOUS (seriously! I thought that a staple characteristic of Trader Joe's was to be small but this one proved me wrong). 3) They had my favorite wine for $2 less than the OP store. Other than that this TJ's had little differentiation from others. It had the same products and sections. Oh - and just because it was spacious did not mean that they challenged themselves to fill it up (restraint that I greatly admire). I almost f,5,2,7/24/2011,MI3wG3R12sQuTGdNvBBX3A,20,313,0

Also like the Hrissa flavor so an added spice and next I am trying one with French herbs like thyme and basil. they have tasting stations all around the room so you can try the oils although they give you little cups and then you drink (?) it I guess.

Although the service was fine the food was virtually flavorless.  It was extremely unimaginative and pedestrian even for American"" Chinese fare.  I have had more flavorful food at the food court in the mall. This place isn't cheap.  Lunch for 2 with only tea to drink ran us up to $40 with tax and tip.  It is a terrible value.  I don't know why anyone would ever come back to this place after eating here once.""",1,5,3/11/2011,9VDrCkfj0IMDSDPgsPKFA,3,51,0

00BlAwESxHF9RCuqp4cqRA,AuQhzw263x31ysaOvtHWKA,If you're the kind of person who gets brain freeze while walking through Home Depot but you need to do a remodeling project these guys are great. Walk through their showroom and point and grunt at things that you like. They'll take the measurements of your room and plot out the project on their computer. Here's the best part though: they order and store all the components of your project (cabinets sinks whatever) and no work starts until everything is in. You hear stories of kitchens taking months and months to complete. With two little kids there was no way we could endure that. Thanks to Beacon our kitchen remodel was done in two weeks. Well pretty much done -- it took us almost two more years to decide what color to paint it but that wasn't Beacon's fault. I wanted a real color ,4,3,10/6/2009,AuQhzw263x31ysaOvtHWKA,169,329,0
00cTmOcPXzYbDOJuMPTqw,DejbySADs66NO3RMAuzBIw,I have to agree with the other reviewers this may be the best restaurant in Nola right now. The crab beignets are so light and airy. They are amazing the best savory beignets I've ever had. The Foie gras is the best appetizer or Lil bite you should allow your body to have. Bathrooms are really cute love the Women's Bathroom Stall Doors are Adorned with Black Silhouttes. I think the bar design needs to be revamped to match the modern cuisine. I love that the menu are Ultraviolet when it's dark. Their dessert plating is phenomenal. They are works of Art!. Highly anticipating my next visit.,4,4,8/12/2012,DejbySADs66NO3RMAuzBIw,15,103,0
00DYbS3zIqVKJ7MWxeIyKw,Q1E3bkn8odFZhnfkGMBSDQ,First the good news: Bricktown has great atmosphere especially the upstairs bar and dining area (also known as the Blackwater Grill). The Bricktown complex (there's also a club banquet facility and takeout pizza) is located in the former Cooper Wagon Works building and the main dining room is beautifully restored with hardwood floors high ceilings exposed brick walls (of course!) and lots of windows. Bricktown also enjoys a great location near the Ice Harbor. However the food is average at best and overpriced - burgers start at nine bucks and you can't find pasta for less than fourteen. The wait staff are friendly but inexperienced and over-worked. Service has been slow on several occasions. Bottom line: there are better choices in Dubuque.,2,1,1/23/2006,Q1E3bkn8odFZhnfkGMBSDQ,123,190,0

Very spacious at over 800 square feet. 2 bath rooms 1 of which has separate bath/shower (shower is big enough for 3 and bath is big enough for 2).

The $3.99 deal for chips soda and a half sub is nice but isn't filling up a hearty appetite. Their croissant sandwiches are great but getting one with chips and soda will put you in the $10+ range. I have a hard time spending that for a sandwich or for a quick lunch.

I simply do not subscribe that more so-so food - correction MORE food period  - makes for a successful dining experience. OPH is the type of place that is great to stumble into (probably still in your pjs if you need be) and put yourself in a food coma to recover from the night before's indulgences.

It might very well be my favorite place to eat breakfast solely based on their Sausage Gravy. It's a very beautiful and delicate (if Sausage Gravy may be called such) combination of herbs and gravy. Poured over a freshly baked buttery biscuit is a warm and inviting way to start out breakfast. Pile your usual favorites on the plate breakfast meats scrambled eggs fresh fruit and banana nut bread and you have a really great and hearty meal. For a buffet (a hotel buffet) the quality is superb but don't think you won't pay for it. Water and coffee is included in the buffet price but not juice or milk.

PLUS they serve beer which many asian buffets don't that was a first I've ever seen in MN to offer alcohol at a buffet. One thing I noticed was that though they did offer sole fish and crab legs they didn't bring it out often enough because every time I walked back up to the counters the trays were always empty which defeats the purpose of paying the extra pricing they have on Sundays for no crab legs. They offer sushi and while I was there always had plenty. I love the fact that they offer spicy mayo and eel sauce on the side with sauce cups for everyone to devour up for themselves.

On the day that I was there it was lovely and sunny and I enjoyed an outdoor table. Otherwise I would have been tempted to sit at the bar and watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen. It's hard to classify the food at Harvest Vine. It's not really tapas in the traditional sense in that the dishes are more substantial and much more beautifully presented than traditional tapas. It's also more haute cuisine than the casual snack style bar food spirit of tapas. I had a nice chat to the chef patron at the end of my meal and he called it Galician food with a twist and that's as good a descrption as any.

01b45G5WBupKjoghjWIBg,q2NZ70jWHUkZVcC8Mj5tig,My husband and I dropped in for a tour; tours are at 1 and 2 on Saturdays and are free which is as good as it gets! He tried the Polestar Pilsner and I had the Nitro Milk Stout. Both had richfull flavors and were served up with a great deal of enthusiasm. I have to say that I am not much of a beer drinker but enjoyed both. The tour itself was similar to most other microbreweries a short story about the grassroots beginning vats and tanks bottling lines...However  our tour guide was super enthusiastic and conveyed love for Left Hand. Know that if you are touring you should wear close-toed shoes or you will have to wear rubber booties for safety. They also supply safety googles though I am not sure why you need either as I did not spot any dangerous conditions but when in Rome.... Th,4,0,10/1/2011,q2NZ70jWHUkZVcC8Mj5tig,5,126,0

I walked into the the locker room and it stank like a H.S. gym. We are off to a good start here. I went into the showers and it looked a little dark. How much are new light bulbs? I get to the pool and I look into the hot tub and there is dead skin floating on the foam. Or dirt whatever you want to call it. I get into the pool and it looked like they filmed a slasher movie here and forgot to clean up. The windows were all dirty and it had that hospital vibe to it. Very dismal.

01K8KR0hcEMvL8YFIvfaOg,42PhSlGg0Lgj6wl9eDjw,At 11:45AM on a Sunday I have no reason to give Gasoline Alley anything less than 5 stars. Add this to the list of amazing places I wish I had found sooner. The service was friendly and not overbearing. Everything was quick to arrive as well. It wasn't crowded but by the time we left an hour left the place was full. I imagine you'd have a bit of a wait then but it'd be worth it. The beer list is great something for everyone. It was Derby Day when we went so I tried a mint julep. VERY strong! The bartender even came over to ask how it was nice service. Portions were very large and I couldn't even finish my sandwich. I had a tuna melt fiance had a rueben and we shard an order of fries. All amazing fresh and very filling.

The host (a little too snooty for my taste) informed us that it'd be a 25-30 minute wait for 'first available' (inside or outside).  He wordlessly handed us a pager and didn't even ask for a name.  So we wandered down the mall a bit to kill some time.  When we returned the stack of pagers that had been at the counter was gone with more people waiting and getting seated.  I thought maybe we had wandered out of range of the pager but the manager (who finally asked for a name to along with the pager) told us we hadn't been called yet.   After we got seated finally everything was great and at this point we were ravenous with hunger.  Our server was fantastic and we,2,0,5/30/2009,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0

I usually head to the Chase to see movies (or the Tivoli for independent films) but when I'm already at the mall & in a mood to see one the Galleria 6 works just fine. One thing you need to know is that you need to get there pretty early... lines can be LONG and don't exactly move quickly. Also because it's a mall there are a TON of kids everywhere... just make sure to bring your patience with you. Once you finally make it the counter the employees are pretty friendly and the snack counter is right when you walk in.

I still have a garlic press that I bought over ten years ago in another WS. Its like new and works like the first day I bought it. Second of all the service is always and i mean ALWAYS exemplary. On this occasion one of the gentlemen in the store kept on feeding us delicious things from cookies to taffy to popcorn. I was so sorry I had just eaten because I would have accepted so much more. Of course I couldn't resist walking out with a few things I really don't need for my kitchen but just had to have.

I'm sure my cardiologist would not approve but holy cow - the food was really terrific.  The whole area had a bit of a Wrigley-town vibe to it (being so close to Coors Field) which was neat.  The owner and staff were quite friendly and accommodating!!!

Pulling into the parking lot (with all the snow) is an obstacle course. Once inside the place had fun/casual written all over it. We sat at the bar area (seated by a super nice/good-looking hostess). The bar area doesn't have a large amount of seating. Plenty of TV's though for the games...The super friendly waitress with a terrific sense of humor greeted us and was amazingly quick/attentive.

And only this because I'm not a sushi fanatic.   Like most San Diego restaurants they're too busy to manage good service.  It's a sacrifice for the Gaslamp district apparently.  A specific (and simple) request wasn't fulfilled and it created a stir in my group leaving a bad memory of the restaurant.  But if I'm in the area again I'd give them another shot.,3,3,7/31/2011,4U380Xqra6lpKWZ6FoO58w,52,393,1

Start off with finely crafted cocktails at the bar - with all of the fresh fruits and ingredients in plain view and sitting over ice. This you must do whether you want to or not because it's a happenin' resto and there's going to be a wait. Ours was only about 30 minutes and we made every second count with a buffet of bevs. As for the fare it's a tough call on what to order but the good news is that they feature small/large plates - and sharing is encouraged! You can't go wrong with anything fried ESPECIALLY the Fried Polenta with mushrooms and gorgonzola cream. This is a rich delightful dish ... but please don't stop there.

Now let's be clear- it's a chinese buffet.  If you have any other expectations then you may be disappointed.  But if you want a buffet this is a decent one. My husband got the Mongolian BBQ he liked it.  He said there were actual steaks back there that could be cooked up to order so that's nice.  And of course his dish was customized and cooked by a chef.

It was also at a time when MB was in the early stages of its Renaissance. This place has evolved into a small micro cosmos of shops dining people watching walking skating cycling and more. It laissez faire atmosphere gives it a allure that can only happen in a place like South Beach.

This one's located in a parking lot and the footing is noticeably unstable so bring good sturdy walking shoes with a thick sole. Lineups at the usual suspects - Blue Bottle ice cream and bread.

But it's a close second. The food is very bland. I had the pasta fasiole to start. I'm a pasta guy but one more noodle and there wouldn't have been room for the fasiole. The special was a prime rib sandwich. The slice of meat was a nice size. It came with a saucer of juice coleslaw and steak fries. Again this was not a horrible meal. But the reason this falls off my radar is that it is the Bermuda Triangle of taste. I had to go here for a work lunch. The only thing I have to say is.

02yrc2jK3SUmdW2oQpxzw,DUtJo3Rz3zqQefLyTzYcxg,When Living Social announced a coupon to get 20$ (pay 10$) worth of cake slices cupcakes etc. at Divine Delicacies I quickly hopped on to Yelp to see if it was worth it. And to be honest it wouldn't have been except for the fact that Living Social had credited me 10$ that was going to expire the following day. So what could I possibly lose on trying 20$ worth of baked goods for nada? Based on the reviews here I imagined that the place would be pretty empty and the workers would be grumpy and hostile. Boy was I wrong. The place was popping at 11am on a Saturday. The store has about six little tables inside which were all taken by people who seemed to be taking part in cake tastings or just hanging around while eating a cupcake.

Also they enclosed the whole outside area so no more breezy summer days with the chance to catch a tan (or a burn in my case) during lunch. We used to go to this place at least once a week for business lunches before they switched over but they've broken our hearts over and over again with the sickly tasting new food that we switched to Quito's for the summer and Leo's for the winter.

I got a chicken tender wrap with lettuce cheese and honey mustard and it was awesome. My BF got some wrap with grilled chicken in it. He was surprised at how good it was.

They also brought in Pad Thai Fish Cakes Salad Rolls from a Thai restaurant. The pad thai is $5.50 for a big container which lasted me for two days. It was a really good pad thai it's more on the spicy side. They usually ran out of the Pad Thai if it's get too late in the day. It's better to call and ask if they still have some.

Bonus that I find the above ground tombs architecturally interesting and this reminder of our mortality grounding. As for the Valence cemetery it makes me really sad that it is so ill kept.  I'm surprised that folks are still being interred here and many of the tombs are collapsing.  Turns out this cemetery is listed on one of the Haunted Tour websites as a top 10 haunted graveyard; not that I can tell and I pass by it often. It's supposed to be open Monday - Saturday from 7:30-2:30 but honestly if you wanted to walk around the fence is only about 2 feet,3,3,1/27/2011,0Igxa1wAstiBDerGxXk2A,302,917,0

We were there on a Sunday afternoon.  The time zone change meant I was hungry but the rest of the restaurant was pretty well empty.  So it seems like the waitress should have had time to refill my drink while we were there yet she didn't. She did however screw up my order.  And she never came by to check on us once we had been served so I could have informed her of that.  I suspect what I ordered would have been quite tasty.  What I was served - less so.

This time they weren't ... until two days later they turned on me in the fridge! Another waste. And finding edible unwrinkled or mushy cherry tomatoes was a daunting task. Unlike some other H-E-B's I've been to recently they don't offer sashimi in their sushi selection. How the heck am I supposed to stay low-carb?! Upside is that they do have a Red Box DVD machine that I've been hitting up a sad number of times lately but not much of a selection. Oh and they have a seriously friendly staff especially the older Black man who stands at the door to greet you and usher a shopping cart your way.

04ghBQjhfx1t5HZ7X5rVpA,KZPCvP0nWRS9OctYf4bubw,Breakfast at the Farmers Market Restaurant is truly a special weekend treat for us!  I love the colorful decor: the painted barstools the cheerful wooden chicken statue and the murals that span the circular dining room are wonderful and add to the country flair.  The food is really scrumptious and fresh.  Most recently I enjoyed the garden omelet.  We're also fans of the biscuits and gravy.  Be careful not to eat too many of the biscuits they serve while you're waiting for your order - they are so tasty and filling! The restaurant definitely gets crowded so we try to go early on a Saturday morning. We've always had pretty good service; although I have to admit that when the tables start to fill the attention of our server declines.  In general though they do their best to handle the c,4,4,8/7/2011,KZPCvP0nWRS9OctYf4bubw,27,135,0

Which was the synthetic oil. Fine I will pay full price for the oil change.

I recommend you order at least 50 minutes prior because the wait is worth for the delicious taste of sauce and oozing cheese! The ingredients are fresh and usually piping hot. I personally like the pan pizza not too thick and not too thin and the crust is definitely baked to dliciousness!!!!! You can order on-line or call in the order regardless they have other item menus worth ordering.

She's lucky she was absurdly attractive or I might have actually disagreed with her. The food was top notch. Omelette was perfectly cooked well stuffed and piping hot. I also tried the mascarpone french toast and king french toast and both were incredible. For $20 we got unlimited drinks for 90 minutes. A bit expensive but we took full advantage.

05RDjTbKVh6Zd0usMhUVA,FAxFj4HQChpKxF6KL0rMnA,Throughout our time at Bradstreet I was giving the place 5 stars.  Every time I try a new place I'm constantly thinking Yelp review and it was top notch until we got the bill.  I had 2 cocktails Lorae had 1 and we split 3 tasty but small plates of food  (read we still had to go out for dinner afterwards) and the total was $75.   I knew it wasn't going to be a cheap date and the food and drink is certainly top notch but I was thinking of all of the great (full) meals that I've had recently for about the same price and I can't help but feel a little ripped off. So here is what we had:  I tried a Pimm's Cup and a Negroni.  Both are classic cocktails and were excellently crafted.  Quality booze mixed well quality non-alcohol ingredients.  $10 a piece.  I don't suppose this is a bad de,3,9,12/26/2009,FAxFj4HQChpKxF6KL0rMnA,87,485,0

Doesn't matter the food the service and the interior of this place more than make up for it.  I went here with my girlfriend for a late night dinner and was immediately impressed with the decor when I first walked in.  It wasn't overly crowded but we were also there late on a Monday night.  I love the unique lighting fixtures that utilize spoons and forks as decoration.  The bar is a stainless steel top which gives the place a bit of an industrial feel too.  Then to offset the cold industrial feel you have the right amount of lighting to warm it up along with the wood ceilings with accent reveals to give it even more contrast.  Architecturall,5,2,5/11/2011,vKUlUXLVylwdttu7h1Y5Q,22,418,1

There are people selling lemonade food and the like but that's about all. Not a farmers market in the typical sense.

As mentioned by many the burgers are just as good as Kuma's and you don't have to wait two hours to get one.  The fries are good as are the side salads if you opt to go that way.  Great beer selection and I love love love the staff.  I'd sleep with all of them if my wife would let me and if I didn't have hang-ups about sleeping with people who touch my food.

064DI0kFwMvmps6x9rMY7w,O46R1fsVyNVKkJIDmjFqg,While this place is good it can be inconsistent at times. Their felafel dolmathes and vegetarian moussaka are particularly good but I found their Spanakopita to be blah and disappointing. The tzadziki - while a basic - is also pretty good especially since this place serves relatively fast food. As for their other offerings I like their  lemonade it is freshly-squeezed and pretty good - a perfect accompaniment to their meals no matter what you choose to have. Unfortunately the baklava was creepily gross. Service can be hit or miss - we've had both excellent as well as not-so-good - but never bad service. For the price the servings are pretty large. While I don't expect made-to-order taste and quality traditional Greek cuisine has a freshness that isn't always there at Tino's.,3,0,9/6/2011,O46R1fsVyNVKkJIDmjFqg,16,385,0

I can't wait to try out their patio area this summer. We had mozzarella sticks  fried mushrooms wingstoasted ravs and spinach artichoke wontons. The wings had a unique flavor and were quite spicy. I am still trying to figure out if they had a hint of habanero? Apparently my husband had never had toasted Ravs before and was quite confused on where the cheese was.

Since the place is so small large groups of over 10 probably should make reservations. Their menu included a large variety of asian cuisine. They had some Chinese dishes Thai entrees Korean appetizers traditional sushi and sashimi and specialty rolls. I ordered the spider roll which was delicious. It was only 6 pieces usually other places give you 8 but it was also cheaper at Hot Wok. Their seaweed salad was a very large portion. I usually get frustrated at other sushi restaurants for charging $6 for a tiny bit of the seaweed salad. However this place gives you a lot!

I had never been in a Tilted Kilt before so I wasn't quite sure what to expect other than folks had told me that it is something akin to a Hooters. We parked our cars in the ample lot and moseyed inside. It was a Tuesday night so the place wasn't very packed. There were perhaps five or six people seated at the bar and about three tables taken out of the whole eating area. We were seated right away at one the pub tables. Our waitress Sammi established herself early as excellent host. When we asked about the drink specials she was able to rattle them off without a hitch plus was able to provide some suggestions as to which dishes to try.

This hotel is located downtown by the financial district but boasts a view of the river and nearby the Statue of Liberty. The location keeps you nostalgic yet the hotel is wonderful. The staff of the hotel is very nice and most of them will tell you how they were renovated since they were also affected by the building blasts and tragedy from the twin towers. Ask to get the view of the memorial. The location is also across from the subway so you can go to mid-town easily. This is also nearby Century 21 if you're looking to shop.

The restaurant and restroom are always very clean and tidy and it is usually very quiet in there.  Great place for a date or conversation.

There are a couple of salads a section of burgers and sandwiches and dinner entrees consisting of steaks prime rib ribs and a couple of seafood dishes.  We weren't in the mood for a huge steak dinner so we stuck with the sandwiches.  I ordered the Chicken Specialty Sandwich which was a perfectly grilled chicken breast with ham mozzarella and American cheeses.  It was huge served on french bread and a side of steak fries.   My fiance ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich that was fried and also served with steak fries.  He said it ,3,0,4/27/2012,2Sq0G8CPcPrKr0tseY3PQ,4,47,0

Every sweet tender bit of these delicious treats are complimented well by their incredible portion sizes and friendly staff. The guy in charge of the corned beef is a sharp as a tac and insists on chiding the customers in a friendly and inviting way that adds that extra bit of flavor to your old school deli experience. $30 buys two people lunch fit for kings.

Their donuts were good but I have to be honest that I was sadly not blown away. They have amazingly unique flavors like Oreo New York Cheesecake Strawberry cake Snickers Blueberry filled Strawberry cheesecake Caramel Apple Blackforest Lemon Carmello Apple Crumble Bavarian Chocolate Iced Cloud Peanut Dutch Crumb Coconut Reese's and Buttermilk.

Once we arrived I was happy to find plenty of parking paved paths to both the big dog and small dog areas and lots of friendly people and dogs.  Of course Minnie stood out like a sore thumb but she had plenty of fun.   I brought the stroller in to the dog park area which wasn't a problem and we hung out for a good half hour or so...

I get my letters and he sends mine. No qualms there. The package guy? Well calling him a lazy-good-for-nothing-jerk-face is putting my feelings ~nicely~ (and a bit immaturely perhaps).

Note...men's section is in the back of the store (if you're coming from the mall) but there's also a door opening up to it from the street. And clearance is right next t men's. The only thing I would change would be how every employee repeatedly asked me if I wanted to open a BR card. I get it...I'll save an extra 15% if I do but after I say no several times...just let it go. :) Overall...I've been a fan of Banana Republic since I was a kid and this location just keeps that love strong.,4,2,12/20/2011,dC5kYsLGGoLLVlMjeMqfLw,21,451,0

I don't remember when or why I first tried them...but I haven't stopped.  I work and go to school in the area and have to restrict myself so that I don't go on a daily basis.  For $1.50 you can taste pure heaven.  I would prefer these desserts to just about any - and that's saying a LOT for someone who loves desserts as much as I do.   After reading the other review now I'm curious to also try their baklava.  I will say though that some of their other treats I've found far too sugary - I've tried one cookie that was very tasty but VE,4,0,10/19/2012,myrcQ3h2G04GvANGoqrg,21,107,0

07sR2y6w8vMSIAAfDU83Cw,2vJ2e51kdbdAmAoHTr4KQ,I love this place for all the earings they carry - just walls and walls of small large irregular shaped shiny or feathery earings. As per other reviews don't expect all your earings to last for years and years as most of mine have either lost a stud or two or I have lost one of the pieces entirely. The first time I came here I went nuts as I thought that the prices were not bad ($10/set max) but the total bill came out to almost $200 something!!!! And for earings that would soon lose its shape allure etc... So as with other reviews becareful how much you put into that little basket. What I found helpful to me is that I will go nuts and put all my earings in the basket...but then think carefully again and most often I end up putting more than half of the goods back on the walls.,3,1,2/13/2012,2vJ2e51kdbdAmAoHTr4KQ,20,178,0

Order on or off menu and you won't be disappointed with whatever the bartender brings you. I loved that they had table service here but the drinks are strong so be careful not to get too soused - there's always that moment of truth when you go to stand up and realize you've had about 200% too much to drink but hadn't noticed because you were barely upright.

I also happened to be SUPER broke so i didn't buy anything but i did leave knowing that there were a handfull of things that i wanted to buy in the future. Really I'm just reviewing the experience. Maybe it speaks to my sheltered midwestern upbringing but i've never been to a place like this and it's a TRIP.  The fish market specifically. Now I know enough from my culinary background to know not to buy some of this fish as the eyes were so cloudy that obviously it was far from fresh.  but then again other varieties were still swimming in their tanks so i think it all depends on the specific product.

When I realized this place was a sushi buffet I was thrilled and quite reluctant at the same time. I'm a sushi lover and the worst place you can eat sushi is at a buffet restaurant. Why you ask? Cuz most of them are just sitting there for a long time so its no longer fresh and the rice quality is poor that when you freakin dip it into your sauce soy they just crumble and float away. Anyhow the look inside is pretty nice. Staff were so friendly and accommodating. So what's the verdict on the sushi? All I can say is I am quite impressed by it.

Emma is the owner of Highland Spa and gave me the perfect pedicure.  She even included a neck and shoulder message while the toenails were drying.  Also love the comfy message chairs she has for you to sit in while she is doing your toes.

It came with a side of slaw and french fries. The fillets were pretty thick and the batter was good. Overall it was an average fish fry but a very good value. The bar seemed friendly and had a quite a few regulars. The bartender and waitress were also nice and quick to bring out fresh fish. They had $2 tall boy cans of Rolling Rock which washed the fish down pretty good. The waitress said that they are known for their hot dogs. I think they had 10 or 12 varieties available and if you can eat all 12 they are free or you get a t-shirt or something like that.

0ABvKoJQzXtmGDOypwJ7sg,USZx55MA2lG2hBu6PWJA,There are many chances that one would get lost in Penn station. I don't want to but can't help it comparing it to the Union station in Chicago. Penn scores more in every category whether it is the round the clock availability of trains its liveliness and not to mention ample food options. But I believe they need more direction signals for maneuvering inside the station it gets sometimes very confusing. The staff at the ticket counters are way too unfriendly.Since NY being the heart of states I think we can do better in terms improving penn station.

My manicure took only about 15 min I think. I did not like how she applied the polish (in stripes) and my chosen nail polish was not drying even after hour (even if it was my favorite OPI). They have OPI and China Glaze nail polishes but I could not find my favorites. They have lots of pink blue and purple. The price for mani pedi is $30+tax not bad but I am not sure if I will go again.

They offer free popcorn which seems to be a big hit. Our service was wonderful. The waitress was so nice and helpful. We had a group of 10 and one of the girls in the party called a few days in advance to reserve seats. She had no problem getting us a table reserved even on a busy Friday night.

I am surprised they let it leave the kitchen looking that way. It happened with another person in our party as well. Folks at our table who had the fish were pleased with their entree. However one gentleman with us ordered the cowboy steak medium rare. It came bloody He sent it back to cook a bit more and he reluctantly accepted it when it arrived as it still wasn't medium rare.

I have brought countless bags of clothing for them to sort through and they take forever just to offer you an insulting price for 2% of what you brought in. I think they take so long sorting through it in hopes of you buying something in the store. Instead I went outside to get lunch then sat in one sofa while they sorted through my stuff haha. If I wanted more clothing I would have kept mine to begin with! They offered me $10 for pairs of authentic 7 for All Mankind jeans from Bloomindale's along with a couple other equally insane offers.

I had the goat cheese stuffed meatloaf.  I felt like the spices in the meatloaf overpowered the goat cheese a bit but the overall flavor was still excellent.  Served with mashed potatoes fried onions and just enough green beans that I didn't feel like had,4,0,11/14/2010,BNuSgYmwrJeOxSFan4HM9Q,28,182,0

I liked it so much that I planned on going back that same week on Friday to get the same thing.  Unfortunately when I walked in the door just past 2pm we were turned away... they close mid-day at 2pm.  Bummer!

We were undecided on a couple of wines so they let us sample a couple before we settled on a bottle of pinot noir.  They have a pretty decent wine list however nothing on draft and really no craft beers.   Ended the meal with the key lime pie and it was one of the best I've eaten.   They have made their outdoor patio into a all seasons room for the winter and that is where we sat.  A little drafty by the window,4,1,12/6/2011,YEJLX5Al2N03i8lixiXXQ,24,147,0

The soft pretzel was GREAT! Doesn't hurt that it's shaped like an atom. Nicely chewy flavored with herbs and served with unique dipping sauces and you can also get it extra spicy with chipotle butter. Beers weren't bad at all. Perhaps not the best you'll ever have but more flavorful than what's typically found on draft (at least in parts of the south and midwest where I live). I liked the Plutonium Porter the best nice depth of flavor...chocolate and coffee...the Amber was good too. If you're in town visiting I'd definitely recommend it.

We love that you get the donut hole too! Was not a fan of their blueberry tea. You can even call ahead and reserve donuts (our drive is so far that they are sometimes sold out). My older son loves the longjohn's and I even tried a nibble of the cream filled - worth the guilt! The chocolate muffins are like cupcakes without frosting - moist delicious and decadent.,5,1,10/5/2011,fBP2Rsng1osoRBgyWx2kag,154,429,0

Was 20 feet away from where Dustin Johnson hit into the crowd at the 18th hole and was 5 feet away from Martin Kaymer when he hit his 2nd shot on the 18th hole during the sudden death. Saw Bubba Watson hit a 366' drive. Overall a great experience great weather visually stunning and world class golfing.,5,0,8/16/2010,AX6TWJtUn0UXKROrR7ZdAw,133,287,0

I stayed here for Coachella and while it was a little bit of a drive it was conveniently located next to the highway as well as the main road through town. So coming and going was very easy. The room I had was very large with a king sized bed couch chair and desk. So no need to worry about space. The pool area was very nice although it was too bad it closed at 10PM especially considering how nice the weather was. The only downsides to the pool were no towels and you had to go through the front door of the hotel to access it. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Everything else was typical Hampton Inn.,4,0,4/26/2012,wB8ATiDKotKsPjEPJgwtw,58,629,0

When you walk in the door all the hope goodness and cheer you have is sucked right out of you. After the recent conversion to a Wal Mart Super center I decided to save a few bucks and do my weekly grocery shopping here. Not a good choice by any means. Yes you will save but I'm not sure it's worth the hassle. For the most part I was a night time shopper. The store was filled with nearly 50 employees but only on person on a register. You get more that one person in line with more than five items expect to wait almost 45 minutes in line. Not what I really want to do after a particularly long night at work.

They came in and set up all of the food for us and will come back to take it all down once we call and tell them we are done.

The brunch menu is short  but the options are diverse. My apple stuffed french croissant was amazing and HUGE! It got the cheese grits and patty cakes as a side. Both sides were seasoned with garlic so I would suggest one or the other.  The pancakes and Belgian waffle also came in very plentiful helpings. At 2.25 the tea and coffee here is a wee bit expensive but it is bottomless. I'd definitely go back again for the food and friendly service. I hear the lunch/dinner menu is pretty good as well.,4,1,7/24/2011,u4df9jjhSsjnrz1wEqFjJg,14,234,0

However I would recommend eating inside preferably in the bar area if you're looking for service.  Belly up at any of their bars - the bartenders are pretty attentive.   FOOD:  Is pretty good.  They jacked up the price the spring of 08 and expanded the menu to include some mexican dishes.  Salads are huge.  Burgers are pretty tasty.,3,2,11/13/2008,nwZ9EpV7SQsj2Sch5Q,53,162,0

I was surprised to see the little building was no longer Mr. Beef's but it was still dee-lish. I went with the regular beef and my friend got the cheesy beef - we were both amazed at the huge size of the sammies and giant portion of fries for such a great price - definitely enough for two meals so we got to enjoy it all twice. Only drawback was a lack in seasoning. My friend dug the cheesy beef but I thought the regular needed just a little...something.

I'm always up for trying new things and this definitely was new things. I'm also a big fan of their halo halo. It's basically a shaved ice but it's purple and it's got fruits in it.

Games include Cranium Cadoo Zigity Conga Hullaballoo etc. Also - you can replenish parts from the website.  The games use pads of paper pencil dice molding clay tokens a decoder mask etc.,5,6,4/8/2006,5FASUSCHFf3YotkKioZ5w,662,1158,0

Their home decor is definitely my favorite. They have items that I haven't seen at many other places or any other place at all. They are popular so they do run out of items fast.

Unfortunately the night we stopped in the band was MIA.  Hey it happens.  However our bartender was so kind conversational and great to chat with that I settled right in. All of a sudden I felt comfortable in Austin (it was my first night there) as I was guided through a taste tour of a few local brews. By the time we were heading out we'd struck up a conversation with a musician just in from Pittsburgh (sometimes instant bonding takes place when people from rust-belt cities meet) who was hanging around hoping to jam with the band later that night. I'm hoping that they were just slightly delayed and it all worked out. Later ,4,3,1/5/2009,0zRLjgw0PQUwqiUCOIgShQ,85,530,0

JB and I never leave empty handed (Justin can't leave any place that sells books without one in hand) and he always scores big in the rare/first addition section. Whether it be a first edition Hemmingway or signed Vonnegut. Every used book has a story to tell (and not just the one printed on its pages) we look for underlined passages notes written broken spines and ask what does it mean? When was it written and why? Stories within stories are sometimes what you'll find and that's worth more than you'll pay.

We stopped in there a couple of days ago for breakfast and it didn't take us long to remember why we have stopped going. The service left a lot to be desired for starters especially since there were only 6 people in the seats but the food was what sealed it.   Between our last couple of visits I have tried the hash and eggs (canned hash is hard to screw up) and plain bacon and eggs. When the bacon has been precooked and then reheated to the point it breaks into shards of glass sized pieces it's time to rethink where you spend your money.

The food is classic American meat and potatoes.  The decor is country the place is clean and the service is excellent.  This is the kind of place the temperance crowd hits Sunday after church no offense intended. The wife had the fried fish platter.  Lots of fried fish.  It was ok.  She had a side of candied beets that stole the show. I had a bowl of the Wisconsin Cheddar soup.  It was more like a dip and it really needed to be Wisconsin Cheddar Beer soup.  It was very good though.  My main dish was chicken and dumplings.  It tasted like it came right out of a can.  No recommendation.

DD's breakfast sandwiches are a lot less greasy than the McDonald's equivalent. Sandwich was hot and tasty and came up fairly quickly. Iced latte was strong and hit the spot.

Perhaps it doesn't happen very often that a dressing room is required but for a blossoming middle-schooler trying on clothes is just about a necessity.  The one bathroom in the shop seconds for the only dressing room so we had to wait for the little ones to take their bathroom breaks before we could try anything on.

The front desk staff were ALWAYS very very helpful and friendly - they even sent up a bottle of champagne and a fruit/cheese platter when we mentioned we were there for a special occasion. The room was clean and very bright and our view out to the ocean was fantastic. We slept with the balcony door open most nights. The lobby bar was a great place to get pre-dinner drinks or hang out for a chill environment. It always had a nice ample crowd so it wasn't your average hotel bar and everyone was fun and friendly. The outside bar is also really cool - we made quick friends with the bartende,5,3,3/24/2009,KO7CuK8p5u4AFGQ7voXe9g,114,561,0

0CueFVtTFgaYVqKwsL9e3g,QfdVvVootXQO5BeEeg7seg,Sherlock's Steak and Seafood is located in the town of Cottleville just up the road from Mannino's Market. Sherlock's which is in the space that was vacated by Travena's is attempting to exist as an upscale restaurant by St. Charles County's standards. It was grandma's birthday and she wanted to try something new. She found a $25 gift certificate for $6 on http://restaurants.com so with Jr. in tow we checked out Sherlock's on Sunday night. Sherlock's has a nice ambiance and a large horseshoe shaped bar. The location really has a lot going for it. I was pleased to see that kids eat free on Sundays and that there's a kid's steak on the menu. This was a huge plus since steak is one of the three things that Jr. will actually eat.

Two of us had burgers one had a chicken sandwhich and one a roast beef sandwhich.  We also shared the fries with burnt ends pickles cheese and something else - it had a clever name that escapes me.  These were tasty. I had the Bravo burger.  Excellent!  The meat is a blend of brisket steak and something else.  Juicy and good sized.  Sweet potato fries were ample but not overbearing. I highly recommend the place.  My colleagues also seemed to enjoy it as well even with high expectations from good reviews.

I usually order the burrito here however everything is pretty good.  Not truly authentic Mexican good but satisfying nonetheless.  I have tried most of the options here and have only been disappointed with the Mexican Chopped Salad which was kind of skimpy.  I guess I should have known better than to order a salad at a Mexican joint!

What's different from the V: -Less Belgian tap beers or beers in general -More fancypants cocktails and wines -I believe they had more in the way of appetizers salads and desserts.

So I headed out to the French Market and found this cute little stand that has vegan options. As soon as I sat down I got about 2 oz of grapes to munch on while I wait for my food. I ordered a white bean and kale soup with brown rice which was served with chopped tomatoes and scallions. It was incredibly filling and tasty. I also ordered a mini vegan black bean burger with avocados and salsa which again was so yummy. The only thing is that I wish they would have dijon mustard instead of French's. But overall delicious.

But then they brought a sampling of homemade breads. Yummy. Main courses came with a protein and then sides. I opted for the meatloaf (recommended by the server) and was not disappointed at all. Good spiced beef with a rich tomato sauce. Also had some fried chicken.  Frankly it was good but at the end of the good it's still fried chicken.

Went with the Charlies burger which was a 1/2 lb ground beef/pork sausage.  I was hoping to add on Avocado but i was informed by the waitress that the Avocados weren't ripe because they aren't in season right now.  Ummmm......OK?  I didn't mention that I saw a Pineapple in the kitchen window and not sure how Pineapple is in season,3,0,2/5/2012,hB5iwMFPVG3dM2zChrgrMw,53,241,0

Which is not a bad deal. Only thing though food wise the only thing i liked was the mojo's fried chicken and there pizza (only the recent cooked ones though). Once the pizza starts sitting under those heat lamps it gets dry and hard.. Not a good combo. Since I did quench the craving I dont think ill be back for a while.

The location seemed a bit small but they had PLENTY of tables! We were seated right away on a Friday night at 7pm!  I ordered the Vegetable Sandwhich...I am praying that is a regular menu item beacuse it was AMAZING! Ok I don't like tomatoes but it had tomatoes zuchini and fresh mozarella on a cabatta bun with some pesto type mayo...OMGEE it was so good.  I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers today!  The fries were very yummy as well!  The hubby ordered the black and bleu burger which he said was very good as well!

Using the Green Line we got off at the Garfield stop and caught the #10 bus and got dropped off at the front door of the museum. There was a giraffe from the exhibit in the lobby and it got me so excited!! (Also no pictures are allowed in this specific exhibit so this was my only chance to get a picture instead of a post card or poster). All in all the exhibit was decent (this was my second time seeing it). I was looking forward to the Circulatory Family but unfortunately it wasn't there this time.

I like bars.  I like casinos.  And moderate-priced drinks in a Canadian casino is a rare thing.  However in the couple times I've been here I always walked out less than impressed and I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it's bland selection of big-brand domestic beers (~$16/pitcher).  Maybe it's the cavernous casino interior being poorly disguised as a local sports bar (I keep thinking the space would be better suited as a swanky lounge/club).  Maybe it's the limited and pricey food menu.

I don't like waiting 30 minutes for a 4 oz sample of beer -- so I get there early. Like right when they open-early. This year this allowed my group to find a lovely table in the shade and by the river.  I was also able to have 15 samples of beer before 3pm when the crowds started getting fuller and crazier.

They look light on the menu but are a decent size for two people. Every season the menu changes a little bit but retains the basics. I've never had trouble finding something I like! The Post Road location always has parking and Siena on The Hill typically has valet.

We showed up at about 9AM on a Saturday and there was a line but the place is bigger than it looks and the line moves fast.  I got 2 eggs and the special roast beef hash and my wife got a quiche with spinach & sun-dried tomatoes.  They were both delicious & filling and made perfectly.  Home fries were better than usual but I would have preferred hash browns. Service was quick and efficient nothing in either order was screwed up and they were busy for entire time we were in there.  There was usually a line and no one seemed to be waiting for more than a few minutes because the line moved fast.  The Golden Egg isn't kits,4,3,3/27/2010,odq8SUSIT8narMOKlZrg6Q,432,926,0

The two must-try's are the Grilled Pear & Asparagus Salad and the Chipotle Seared Seitan. If you didn't know that Seitan is basically flavored Gluten you'd think it was chicken. Really. The Grilled Pear & Asparagus salad is amazing. It comes with these candied little nuts that just bring everything together. Even though I'm a meat eater I have no problem getting this as a meal.

0EjNzxHKPILqyjJK4a9OQ,q2NZ70jWHUkZVcC8Mj5tig,Surprised to see many haters; this is my go-to Pad Thai pick. The Pad Thai is sweet without being over the top served in generous portions and inexpensive. The service is speedy; while it seldom  blows my mind I will say it has been fairly consistent. I have noticed over the past few years the portions have decreased as the price has increased but overall it's so reasonable ( under $20 for 2 entrees) it hardly seems worth complaining about. Parking is tight and often unavailable in the lot so look for a 2 hour spot on Colfax. Also making use of the tip from a previous reviewer to request a seat away from the door in especially cold or hot weather will ensure your visit is more pleasant.,4,2,8/20/2011,q2NZ70jWHUkZVcC8Mj5tig,5,126,1

They specialize in local food products including a very nice selection of local produce.  Apparently stock varies from day to day depending on what is available from the local farms but they had a really nice selection when I visited.   I picked up some mini-Japanese cucumbers fresh local corn a mini eggplant and a nice field tomato.  All,5,16,9/28/2010,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,0

This spot is a cuchifrito done right. Its been here longer than anyone in my generation and is a staple of the community that is rapidly losing its identity. The food is fried greasyand definitely bad for you - which creates that deliciously wicked appeal that Latinos in NYC often crave.

This i was expecting since we went on a Sunday late afternoon. They have a big bar area and a little waiting area which is rather ingenious if you ask me. Once we got to our table we were taken VERY good care of by our server. I wish I could remember her name because she did a phenomenal job. We stated out with a shrimp and lobster dip.

The number of glowing reviews and the articles in trusted magazines should have lead to a positive and memorable experience at this restaurant. What happened was a disaster on a lot of levels. What I can safely start off by saying is that this restaurant has by far the worst hostess of all time. I introduced myself and noted my reservation in French... then in English because she gave me a blank yet critical expression. Speaking English didn't help matters much. She looked down and then answered the phone. Now there was no one behind us and no one walked in while she was on the phone so we waited. And waited. And waited.

It does seem like I'm in the minority with being overall dissatisfied with Magazine Street Animal Clinic... Positives: I really liked the vet who saw my 2 cats. She was personable gave them good attention- while at the clinic- and very communicative about everything with me. I brought them in due to an ongoing flea problem my older cat Iphy's weight loss and for check ups and blood work. I figured it would be pricey but I was prepared for that because I will-and have- done anything it takes to keep my pets alive and healthy. And yes it was a costly visit to the tune of over 300 dollars (I also purchased flea and worm meds as well as a supplement for older cats).

Seems to be so far!   Can you act like an uncivilized person who's portraying every stereotype of college available and expect no consequences? Nope.. and you shouldn't be allowed to. The staff have always been very nice and cordial in all of my interactions.. the people that write negative remarks on here are also the same people who probably come into the building with a bad attitude and guests who can't follow the rules.  This is a college housing facility ... as such you must understand and abide by the rules of the community.. if you aren't willing to do that don't live here.   This place is great for someone new to the city who doesn't know enough,4,2,7/2/2012,4vyIItbdZ80s0HVlGhAJdg,20,114,0

It is convenient and clean.   Going back to the early 1990s when I was using a land line I have been a fan of 7-eleven's flavored coffee. After all these years I still savor their blueberry coffee. On those 100-plus days in Vegas I'll pick up a Big Gulp.  Seven Eleven's wild card is the fuel station.When it is time to  fuel up my car I will try to go here. Coffee and fuel.  A few years back when they changed from Citgo to 7-eleven branded fuel I was skeptical. That was a couple of years ago. I had used 7-eleven branded fuel numerous times throughout my Aura's lease and I had zero problems.  The employees here are also friendly.,4,1,7/10/2011,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,66,250,0

I did a newbie's week for 15 and tried out a few pilates classes. Each one had a different instructor and each class title was a tad different. The special is a good way to mix it up and see what you like. They have an email list that sends you weekly updates and they offer you little price incentives and some free classes after they notice you aren't coming in any more.

I heard of LURE when it first opened earlier this year but had no idea it was in Chinatown. An Izakaya in Chinatown!? Didn't make sense to me! Even when we were sitting inside I kept saying...it's so weird we're in Chinatown right now. It's just so different then anywhere else in Chinatown. The atmosphere is sleek & modern as is the decor dark mood lighting with a blue lights giving it a lounge type of feel with some actual good hip hop playing (not radio songs) or good instrumental hip hop beats. Loved it. We started with both sake flights they offer...me getting one and my friend getting the other. The waitress was exceptionally great explaining,5,1,12/18/2011,QnIrewrXxFnsswgG1gFQ,76,738,0
0g3Sbobdb9t9no1pRz7g,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,I think that the address is wrongly given as Fulham Road at the moment. Royal China is in a small side street Chelverton Road just off Putney High Street. It shares its illustrious name with other branches of Royal China in London but I understand that it is independent of them. The restaurant is quite intimate and shares its black and gold design with the other Royal Chinas. They have recovered well from a kitchen fire a few years ago. My sister and I used to come here regualrly for Sunday dim sum until we discovered Confucius which is closer. Royal China restaurants are famous for the quality of their dim sum and this branch is no exception. The portions and quality of ingredients is first rate.

The instructors are high energy explain the moves and are positive influence which in turn make you have a good time and get in shape. I love how I can go to their classes and burn 600 to 700 while having fun you can't beat it.

I echo the sentiments of other reviewers in the lack of a location to showcase the performing arts in Las Vegas. Wicked seemed like an excellent choice having seen it at the Gershwin in 2010. During the first ensemble song I found myself struggling to make out the words. At first I thought it may have been the performers and wondered if the traveling show may have had less talent than the version I had seen. However during the ensuing solo number I was shocked to hear the same thing. Then during the crescendo of that first song there was a loud distinct crackling of the speaker on the right side of the stage.

While offering the same menu this restaurant is actually built to be a restaurant. The seating is normal and there are no sofas. They also have two bars. One bar is pretty large on the main floor and there is also another smaller bar at the top. Instead of selling books this BBP sells clothes and other miscellaneous items. The art is awesome and the architecture is even better. The spiral steps in the middle of the restaurant keep the place unpretentious. The crowd is different here than at the other BBP.

The service wasn't that friendly. For a huge group of us they only had 2 large pizzas and 2 pitchers of drinks which was a rip-off.

0GqW14jGT73uLBiwBe04oA,biZ0fIcZp7BKBJ3EGcX7Q,A cute little place tucked away among the business that line Main Street in downtown Downers Grove. I came in a few times in the evening while waiting for the bus. The first time I had a beef sandwich with fries. The beef sandwich was excellent! It had just the right spice and came served on this delicious baked (just enough of a crisp) french bread and just enough juice with it so you got the flavor but didn't make the sandwich fall apart soggy. Topped with baked mozzarella and some hot peppers I was thoroughly impressed. The second time around I tried a Chicago style hot dog. Yes a hot dog it was but Chicago style it was not. No poppy seeds on the bun no celery salt and way too many chopped tomatoes. The place itself is small but very cozy. You place your order at the counter,4,3,2/7/2010,biZ0fIcZp7BKBJ3EGcX7Q,268,543,0

You can choose to run either 3 or 5 miles. There are one or two 'team leaders' (employees) who run with the group. I heard about the social runs via Fleet Feet's Facebook page and I knew I had to attend. I showed up by myself and felt immediately welcomed into the group. Everyone was just so darn friendly!

NOLA has such a varied menu for breakfast ranging from the usual suspects to unique eats like the french toast brioche at Dante's Kitchen corned beef hash with andouille boudin and hash browns at Surrey's or the duck waffle at Elizabeth's. Elizabeth's is another great eat for breakfast (and a quite wonderful lunch/dinner choice too). I get the country breakfast often (smoked pork chops topped with eggs and gravy). The pork chops are some of the tenderest and most flavorful I could ever recall. I also really enjoy the fried green tomatoes with poached eggs and a hollandaise sauce.

There's 11 empanadas you can choose from and with the order comes this homemade sauce that tastes like a mixture between mayo cayennne pepper and a few other spices.  Some of the empanadas are a little bit on the dry side (the chicken empandas especially) so the sauce definitely helps.  The homemade hot sauce is a must--has a great onion flavor and some bite to boot.  The empanadas themselves are flavorful but a lot of them missed the mark by being too dry or not having enough filling--it seems big but as soon as you bite into them there's a giant air pocket. The perks of this place are that they differentiate between the different empanadas by having the empanada number pressed onto the edges so you're able to tell.  Also free d,3,1,4/8/2012,crXbzjmEjkyyT95SAwug,4,61,0

There's something for everyone choose a classic American dish like bisque or a cesar salad or go with some Asian flare. This location has a fantastic patio. A little noisy perhaps. Some kind of partition with the road might go a long way like some tall shrubbery. Despite this it's still a great place to share a leisurely weekend lunch in the sun and feel connected to the hustle and bustle of old Dublin. My only complaint is that J. Liu's perhaps plays it a little TOO safe. I'll make the recommendation for picky eaters or only borderline adventurous ones.

I would have preferred Wendy's chili over all but 5 or 6 of them. It was $10 at the door to get a wristband that enabled you to eat as much chili as your heart desired. The best part of the cook-off was the spacewalk. All of the kids were loving it. They also had a mechanical bull and a rock-climbing wall for the older kids and adults.

With that in mind I sought out Christian Campbell's Tavern which promised an authentic period meal. George Washington was reputed to be a regular customer at this establishment The owners certainly tried to recreate the whole experience with waiting staff dressed in colonial dress and wandering musicians. Apparently singing was a very popular form of entertainment and we were treated to a few performances through the evening. The menu was dominated by seafood. I was looking to try some local dishes and the fricassy of shrimp scallops and lobster was recommended. It was nice and was served with brown pilaf rice which maybe stretched its 'local' credentials!

Langoustines are easy to eat but not much meat. Perhaps I will order it with shrimp instead for next time. The sauce is DELICIOUS. I found myself eating the crab leg meat dipped in that sauce! I didn't get the complimentary ceviche like everyone else. I got a frozen margarita and that was strong AND cheap. I wasn't particularly a fan of the fried tortillas wrapped in a plastic bag.

Not your fault but still...just venting. Our waiter brought out a cart and showed us the entrees.

A few more conventional notes:   - The museum located next to the memorial isn't complete yet and I'm not sure when it will be considering the recent funding debacle.   - Tickets are free but have to be reserved in advance.  There's obviously high security around this site but there was no wait for entrance/security when I was there despite the memorial being crowded so apparently things move pretty efficiently.,5,1,7/22/2012,RP0CMuZ9byvCyhR3gbagQ,0,37,0

I liked how they explained what was going on to obvious newbies and let us go at our own pace. The one thing I didn't like (and this is me being nit picky) was that the appetizers at the salad bar were not identifiable.  Maybe its my age or lack of food knowledge but I would've appreciated knowing what I was eating. The service was great and timely too. I would highly recommend it for a special occasion.,4,1,7/11/2011,zBLwbe5C3hC7F5Jij4BxVQ,4,76,0

The caveat is there's no rhyme or reason in terms of where they're located throughout the store (e.g. there might be a few sale skirts in the skirt section or a marked down shirt with the tank tops but it would require you looking at every price tag to figure out where the goodies are). I find that it's easiest to just ask the sales associate to show you where the sale items are if that's what you're looking for - it saves a lot of time!,4,2,9/25/2010,D7R935yDAGHVXBj9wkG31g,36,333,0

The very nice waitress told us after we asked what took so long that they only had 1 cook working. It would behoove the waitress to set expectations right away so customers don't expect their food as fast as the Double T normally serves it. My mom's fruit salad was literally rotten and the manager was nice enough to deduct a whopping 75 cents for it off of our bill. The waitress also never brought us our check .. I waited about 10 minutes and then had to ask the manager for it.

I love the comfy booths they are perfect setting for chatting with buddies before a show. Drinks are good prices are moderate to high if I remember correctly. Also there is plenty of space to spread out if you group is large or if you run into an awkward turtle situation (awkward turtle = ex-boyfriend non grata).

This location lacks a decent countertop to mix in your sweeetnersetc: So they remedied it by placing everything on top of a waste basket by the front door.  Walking in or out you are bound to bump into someone topping off their drink.  Some adjust to that problem by using the tables so you will find random empty packets straws etc on the tables.

0IxaKdnULsTUvlwiow,JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg,I've been to Whippersnapper Gallery for two types of events. One was a raging success while the other was mediocre at best. As an art space Whippersnapper is terrific. It's quiet spacious and there's room for a makeshift bar in the back corner where you can serve drinks and snacks. The location is convenient. As a concert venue (recently saw Brian Borcherdt here) it's a sweaty mess and probably even a fire hazard. There's a huge bottleneck in the centre of the room where people are trying to push past the crowd and over to the stage area (which was at the back this time). There's no coat check and no official bar since it's essentially just an empty room. So you have to drop your stuff down somewhere at your own risk.

Last time we were there it was quite crowded which was good to see but I think it also slowed down the service a bit. Just a bit.

And we ended up sick. For the second time. I didn't even manage more than two bites of my dish because it was that bad. I had asked how it's cooked prior to ordering I was told it's cooked and not fried and sure enough my food was breaded and deep-fried. The menu doesn't say anything about it being fried either and that was why I asked to begin with (I remembered the dish from last year).

Took about 35 mins for the food to come out and then it was only so-so. Manager type asked about experience we told him and even he seemed uninterested.

You've read the mostly true reviews on the furniture already. Shop the AS IS bin and you may get some good deals. Lighting is also OK here. We have a TV stand from IKEA going on 3 years now  but I think that is rare. What I like here the most is CHEAP HOT DOGS. They recently raised the price to  65 or 75 cents but they are a quick decent snack. Parking is sufficient at this center except on weekends when you are competing with the Lowes.

(I'm not good at the poem stuff.  Let's move on) Ligaya is cool.  She gave me my third compliment (about my 3-hole punch Halloween costume) and a bunch more since.  Also she's put together some incredible party-related fun in the brief time that I've been elite:  the Nile Meetup night the Old School Prom the Club Cafe Karaoke the Cafe Rustica Meetup and the Bigfoot Institute Reading.  I've had experiences at these that I would never have had if not for Yelp and her hard work many of these with photographic evidence!  And she's good people too something that you don't always find in the world.

Don't be afraid to ask about the items in the menu- like I mentioned they are proud of their cuisine so it is actually a treat to hear them describe the items in their menu with enthusiasm.

My refurbished slightly outdated Tom Tom GPS had me across the street near an apartment complex. I will not go into specifics as everything I have had there has been very fresh and prepared with care. The rolls are big and nicely filled...sushi fatties. Love the Bento box on occasion.

My favorite parts were the sandhill crane exhibit (since others passing overhead kept landing and joining in) the bison tiny painted turtles and frogs (keep a lookout under foot) a wild turkey who may or may not have wandered in on his own but gobbled nonestop and the bald eagles.  The only disappointing part was that the wolves we did see were somewhat 'pacey' but what do you expect when they don't have full range?  Overall it's a very nice attraction.,4,4,7/21/2010,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0

I just feel that anywhere else (minus the Pearl and LO) I would have paid less for what I got. The restaurant itself is cute. It's a sports bar adorned with memorabilia. They also have a couple plasma TV's playing current sporting events. Upon request your server will give you the remote and let you choose what to watch. My friends daughter opted for Lacrosse. Yawn.

We walked into the room about the size of a house basement. Sat down with our already ordered drinks and listened to the show. Horrible. The comedy club was not funny. What can you expect for free? I guess not much. The only funny part was the host who happened to be female. Otherwise everyone else was horrendous! Avoid it all costs.

The menu while not terribly large has a nice selection of soups salads and hot/cold/pressed sandwiches at affordable prices. The restaurant offers only counter service prior to 3PM then the dining area becomes table service afterwards with expanded dinner menu selections. They also offer a limited beer and wine selection if you're dining in (Happy hour from 3-6PM Monday through Friday with 1/2 price beer). Prices are on par with what you'd expect from a higher-end deli and are compensatory to the quality of food.

We got seated immediately. We looked through the menu and to be honest the price of the entrees including noodle dishes and rice dishes were pretty high for Thai food. There's nothing under $9 on the menu. I decided with the Duck Curry and asked for it to be hot. Got my food and it wasn't hot at all.

It's pricey.  I've gotten the ham and turkey and honey dijon sammich.  That plus a drink came out to $10.   As Sara notes with places like Anna's and Villa Mexico beating that price easily as does Subway (though I will give this place a lot of credit for being better run than the Subway). 3.  The food is okay though average for the price you're paying.  I mean it's in a high-traffic lunch area so that may dictate things (MGH being nearby and all).

Our waitress forgot Lara's soup and her milk and the manager forgot to bring me my Heinz 57 steak sauce. I really did not need that sauce because the steak was actually a tasty cut of meat. My steak may have even been a local resident of the surrounding area before I ingested it.  I am thinking my eggs may have been local at one point too as they seemed very fresh. My only complaint with the food was with my coffee ,3,4,3/7/2008,RO78jiBkX61pPweJLVlCgA,232,893,0
0lZ8XfMurljaJ6ZsfhzmyA,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,* Palo Alto version of Mexican food * I was in Palo Alto and craving good Mexican food and asked for some recommendations.  Reposado was the answer.   I had hoped for more of a hole-in-the-wall rather than a spot that has Opentable reservations.  But it is Palo Alto afterall...... We ordered: - Gordita de Langosta:  The consistency of the gordita itself was a bit rubbery as if it had been reheated.  The toppings of lobster polenta and arugula were an upscale version.  The lobster was cooked nicely and seasoned well.  Overall an ok dish with 3 stars. - Red snapper ceviche: The snapper was very nice and the hint of spice from the habaneros worked really well.  The 3 little chips they served with it were not enough.  But I digress.  4 stars. - Caldo de mariscos:  The broth was excellent.,3,11,11/7/2010,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,1

Located in a strip mall setting on Lake St. there is plenty of parking.  It looks like it fills several units in the strip so it appears to have multiple entrances but there is actually only one. Once you find the right door and enter you are immediately greeted by the hosts at the greeter station/checkout counter.  There are lots of tables and booths and they need every one of them.  I have always been lucky enough to be seated immediately but Brunch Cafe does get busy.

The thing I like about this gas station though is that for years they were the only station between Liberty and Kearney. When the area became developed enough to support two stations QT got a license to build a station not just close but right next door. Did tiny little Pour Boys stumble and resolve to be driven out of business like QT surely hoped? Nope. They renovated the place nearly doubled the convenience shop and the number of pumps before QT could build their location. The result is that Pour Boys has just as good of a location possibly a little better and now 5 years later is still in business.

Still it was a decent bowl of Pho Ga - just not great. The chicken was as tender as I have ever had the bowl of broth was steaming away and the veggies/aromatics were fresh and in fine fettle and the noodles were not clumped up. Service was excellent.

With a name like My Daddy's Cheesecake I was expecting the cheesecake to be homemade awesomeness. Boy was I wrong! All we wanted was cheesecake. We got a slice of Key Lime (a specialty of my Mom's) and Peanut Butter. I don't know what how they store the cakes but our pieces were smooched on the top and partially frozen...or so cold it was on the verge of freezing. Aside from that the cheesecake was dry. When I cut into it it crumbled because it was so dry. I like my cheesecake moist and creamy this was the opposite. The flavor of the Peanut Butter one wasn't super rich in flavor it flopped on the flavor meter. Now the Key Lime is my Mom's specialty that she makes with fres,1,2,6/12/2010,7fDqaGdUMccXQ4bnPwR6yg,76,675,0

Both were excellent but the beef on the Half and Half Bowl was out of this world when combined with the Teriyaki sauce! Seriously I wished I ordered the plate instead that's how good it was. If you're thirsty the restaurant offers some type of smoothie that is more like an Icee than a true fruit smoothie. They blend crushed ice with a flavored powder to mix your drink.

0nIreTY3fxbUU9KmdrIw,nwZ9EpV7SQsj2Sch5Q,Real Impressed!!!! For this place to be the cheapest hotel package in downtown is a little insane! We were really just looking for a place to crash over the weekend but we instead got a pretty posh room and outstanding location to Michigan Ave/Rush St/Division St. The beds and pillows are heavenly so I woke up refreshed (despite the hangover headache). The bathroom has decent shampoo/conditioner/lotions and a nice shower head but the best part was the actual full-sized blow dryer (none of these travel-sized junkers).  The hotel bar had an interesting array of tap beers. Splash - the pool is on the roof with an amazing view!  The concierge was awesome - we emailed him a few questions before we arrived and he answered them promptly.  The service when we checked in was so-so.

They seated us immediately and our server came over to take a drink order from us.  We ordered a round of beers and had a look over the list.  We weren't sure how much food to order so we decided that we'd get an appetizer each a steak and order 2 sides. We ordered a shrimp appetizer 2 NY strip steaks (medium rare) hash and spinach.  We ordered another beer of course!

It was a perfect early September day and we had to find a place to eat outside. I'll start by saying that I've lived in St. Charles for ten years and I've never found a place on Main Street that is anything better than mediocre. Today's trip to Lewis and Clark's was very typical. Nothing terrible but certainly nothing to write home about. This is a great choice if you want to feel the old town St. Charles ambiance with a great view of the Missouri River and the cobblestone streets. Just go in knowing that this why you are here not for spectacular food or even average service.

We shared a green tea creme brulee which had just the right amount of caramelization for the brulee. It's creamy and has the best green tea flavor without being overly sweet. I also enjoyed how it's not bitter at all; some green tea flavored desserts tend to leave a bitter aftertaste but that's not the case here. It also comes paired with a pear ginger sorbet sitting on top of glazed oats. The sorbet has the perfect texture and has only a hint of ginger flavor. Awesome because I don't like overpowered ginger flavor. Presentation is also a plus it has such a nice twill to top everything off!

We did a quick sweep of the store and we were about to leave when I pointed to some t-shirt displays that had wings with them. Jeff asked an employee and she eagerly pulled a pair of white wings and black wings from behind the counter (why they were behind the counter and not on a rack I still don't know). That employee was Jeff's personal angel. She carefully listened to his costume idea and went so far as to hook him up with a pair of faux leather booty shorts and black mesh tank top. While he was trying them on in the fitting room our angel employee explained that she needed to go on break and that another person would help us. That's when it went downhill.

The clothes are actually very cute and one wall is entirely devoted to party dresses arranged by color. I love seeing the rainbow of dresses which makes me want to buy more (marketing trick perhaps?) The only thing with me is that I will never buy clothes at full price because there always seem to be a sale (or whenever I am there and I walk by the place at least every month for window shopping). I always buy my clothes at 50-75% off and the associates are always very good in showing the racks that have the clothes at discounts. For those who are looking to go out for a night of clubbing/disco/dancing Lemor has really unique tops and skirts that will make you stand out.

0OiBwbQbmlJ4kW8BicBoQ,fuI7UzyTnqLKND1pDgjA,I finally broke down and picked up the 24-hour gym. That benefit is worth every penny of the nearly $600 I paid for it. Yes yes that's high. However if you have an erratic schedule and want to do something consistently healthy for yourself it's the only way to go. I go on my hours and have my choice of equipment. I haven't had to wait for equipment at all which... is... nice.   They also hooked me up with an on-line meal and fitness tracker which has saved me a lot of journal writing.

While it's cool that students stand behind the basket I would love to have a student section like Duke where the student section is on the court opposite the bench. I agree that UC should build a new basketball arena but where? The campus doesn't have room build a new arena. Plus when a big east foe like St.Johns only draws 8300 fans while build a new 15k arena.

Other people mention the sights you can see from the bridge and they are impressive...the skyline the water the other bridges.    But what others don't mention is the sound.  The sound of the water from the nearby falls is so soothing and hypnotic.   When in Minneapolis I loved running across this bridge toward the city and seeing the views and hearing the water.  I can't believe that anyone would rate this bridge fewer than five stars.,5,0,9/16/2012,wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,23,494,0

To begin with their coffee is organic and to anyone whose never drank organic coffee I can guarantee you this is some of the best I've ever tasted second only to a vaction my wife and I took to Nicaragua and visited the coffee region!

However having stayed at several of their hotels in the last year I have to say that I'm most impressed. The website is clear comprehensive and it's easy to compare several nearby hotels to choose the most suitable one. My family and I stayed at this Premier Inn in Birmingham city centre earlier this year to attend the All England Badminton finals at the National Indoor Arena. The hotel is perfectly located in the city centre close to all the shops and restaurants but only 20 minute walk along a pedestrianised route from the NIA. There is some metered parking outside the hotel but for longer term parking it's best to use one of the many public car parks nearby.

The samgyupsahl was FROZEN.  It wouldn't melt even after 5 minutes on the grill.  The galbi and thinly sliced beef were very chewy.  Frozen and chewy do not come to mind when I'm trying to imagine what good Korean BBQ places should be. Also Korean BBQ places always bring out complimentary dwenjangjjigae (Korean tofu bean curd soup) and rice whenever you order galbi.  Most places do it right with pieces of tofu some onions and jalapenos thrown in and Korean red pepper ,1,2,3/25/2012,crXbzjmEjkyyT95SAwug,4,61,0

It was like eating a mouthful of beans mixed with sand. My burrito was veggie. I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the veggies themselves but with one bite I could tell that something in my burrito had definitely gone off. With my stomach turning from the funny smell I threw the burrito directly into the bin. I am confident that I narrowly avoided food poisoning.

Usually I get down to The Birchmere at least 30 minutes before the doors to the Box Office open to insure I get close to the front of the line and thus end up with seats close to the stage. Well that was not going to happen for once. I could not get out of work in time to do this - and ended up arriving about 7:10 pm (the performance begins at 7:30 pm).

For me personally I think it's a little shabby and the bathrooms are very small.. but again the prices are so reasonable you could really afford to stay there probably twice as long as you could at any other hotel in the area.  And it's clean and comfortable.  Its not fancy and if you like chic luxury linens you are in the wrong place but its definitely a contender...

I've spent quite a bit of time here and luckily now it's just ten minutes or so from my apartment. I've been to COCA for a few different reasons the main reason being that the company I used to dance for held their season showcase here every April. Some of my best memories of COCA are being backstage waiting to perform. They have a HUGE backstage area to their main stage and it's definitely ideal for a big group. Plenty of room to stretch and get ready to dance and there are also outlets everywhere which accommodates the massive amount of curling irons straighteners whatever you need to plug in to get ready for a show.

I've found the staff here to be unfriendly or at least not positive. But the store seems clean and the food is on par with other TSCs. However despite breakfast items showing on the menu this location no longer makes anything with eggs. They told me rural Georgians prefer to eat at places like Hardees so they couldn't afford to keep supplies to rarely make those. Disappointing but fair enough. They should take those items off the menu or cover them though. Two outside tables are available so you can bring your dog.

If you don't have transportation though this is a convenient place to stay hence the four stars. Apparently Super Shuttle comes here for $25 each way; I had my own rental car. I think parking was in the teen dollar amount e.g. $15/day but the hotel didn't charge me for parking after all (nice!). A shuttle runs per your request within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. You can tell the very nice and friendly shuttle guy anywhere you want to go within this distance. He'll also give good recommendations for dinner or shopping.

Their menu is so wide it's great to go there with people who have different tastes and all are in the mood for different things. It's a little small but worth the wait. They don't take reservations for less than parties of five or more so you may be waiting but you can enjoy a seat at the bar. Court Street is situated on a cute cobble stone street in Hoboken just off Washington Street and has a nice atmosphere. It's great for friends or family.

Place was packed when we arrived for lunch on a Thursday It was cold and blustery out - perfect Pho weather. I ordered the Spring rolls (not fried) and a bowl of Pho Ga. When the soup came out I was surprised to see something floating in the broth that I had never seen before - two small white orbs that looked like eggs. Turns out they were quail eggs. *shrug* Okay I'll try anything once. For me the flavor of the Quail eggs did not enhance the Pho experience - I felt like the flavor was at odds with the rest of the Pho. The eggs were hardcooked on the outside - yet the yolks were still partially in liquid form. The rest of the soup however,5,3,11/8/2008,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,1388,2530,1

We ordered the pot stickers fried and Mom who is not a pot sticker fan loved them. The grilled shrimp came with four very large shrimp and were quite tasty. You had to remove the shells and they were super hot (temperature) served with a nice spicy sauce. The egg rolls were not very interesting. Our threesome shared two entrees - one shrimp one chicken. The best thing about Siam was the freshness of the food. Everything took a while but you could tell it was cooked to order and not sitting around.

Landshark Beer Garden) is like a radio station catch it at the right time it is entertaining but catch it at other times it is just there.  Twice we caught the Navy Pier Beer Garden (from this point forward referred to as the Beer Garden) when it was entertaining. On Sunday the sounds of Fortunate Sun a CCR tribute band led us to the Beer Garden. The Beer Garden is an enjoyable venue to view live acts free of charge. It is outdoors and has sufficient seating and some shade. There are a few concession stands that serve Land Shark beer and other beverages. By the way cups of draft beer start at $4.75. Not cheap but far less than the $8 beer in a Las Vegas bar.   The Beer Garden is as entertaining as the act playing on the stage. Fortunately for me Fo,4,0,8/6/2012,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,66,250,0

We decided to eat chain Mexican food because I had a coupon and had heard Chevy's was pretty good. The chips and salsa were amazing... but we had to ask for the spicy salsa. The default salsa was fresh but pretty blah no kick at all. For the meal we both got the Chevy's Cinco which was $12.99 for 1 beef taco 1 beef enchilada 1 chicken enchilada 1 pork tamale and 1 chile relano. That is a lot of food. I only ate 2 things so I had an extra meals worth of left overs. I was not impressed with the chile relano. It was mostly fluffy breading and not the gooey cheese I have grown to expect.

We went during the lunch time and tried the lunch buffet. This place was a complete disappointment when it came to food. They did had the usual buffet fair on display but food lacked flavour. I tried the Pakoras(deep fried veggies) Dal makhani(Lentils) Bhindi masala(Indian style okra) Aloo Mutter(Peas and potatoes) with rice and naan. To start with the Pakoras were way too salty dal makhani had no flavour- it didn't even taste like the usual dal makhani. Bhindi masala just had way too much oil and no spices(way too bland) and the aloo mutter were sweet. So bascially all the veggie enterees sucked.

If you want to hit the salad bar - I've noted that the offerings look a little dubious if you go in the evening - best to hit the salad bar earlier in the day.

The place is small and off the strip with plenty of older folks gambling away. The bottom floor is for cards and slots while the top floor they offer bingo and the food sectioned off with the cafe then the buffet. Food at the buffet was HORRIBLE or shall I say Terrible to match the hotel's name. It was like food from a poor school's cafeteria disgusting room temp food that looked like a pile of mush.

We then spent 15 minutes practicing our falls on two mats at ground level. From there it was go time. There's a giant 50+ foot platform with a small metal ladder on the side.

That's good and bad but the good is that it seems like the local business people find it to be a good place to eat. They have a large menu.

It was odd (I've never combined all of those) but very tasty.  A friend ordered the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce. I scored a taste and think I'll get that next time.

Some things I love about sub places: when I can pick my bread when I can select additional toppings when I can choose my type of cheese... so essentially when it's made-to-order (and not from pre-cooked ingredients left there to settle and die).

The menu is mostly sandwiches a variety of appetizers and a few salads.  I had the Rosie Salad with mandarin oranges strawberries candied wa,4,1,11/27/2010,7fDqaGdUMccXQ4bnPwR6yg,76,675,0

Herbie is usually very well behaved and hasnt pee peed in a house or store until this tragic day.It started off with him jumping out of car in the parking lot tearing off his collar and running for the petco door. He loves this placeI told him he could pick out a toy he was pumped! So pumped that he peed 4 times within maybe 5 mins. I ignored the last accident paid and ran for the door the dog caused me enough embarrassment I had to get out! So thanks for the doggie clean up and sorry for Herbie loving your store so much he lost control of his lil bladder.oooppps,5,1,2/1/2010,bmtNNp1vzcLZTyVudQFIw,22,229,0

If your'e on a mission to snag some designer steals (I always am when I come here) forget sifting through the racks of clothes in the middle of the store - those are mid-level brands at super-low prices. Instead hit the small racks on the right side of the store starting across from the jewelry island when you walk in. Here I've found plenty of Juicy Couture (75% off) a black cropped blazer from Marciano (80% off) Seven jeans (50% off) and plenty of clothing from Splendid Velvet C&C California Michael Kors and tons of other designers I can't remember at the moment. The trick is to know which brands are the high-end ones ahead of time so you know which items to pluck off,5,5,7/13/2010,D7R935yDAGHVXBj9wkG31g,36,333,0

Flavors were okay but everything was just too plain. The spices and sauces lacked pizazz and the base ingredients didn't make up for it (veggies and chicken were a little overcooked for my taste).

0r6qQageQ7a8DSZCKvgD1w,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,This Sainsburys supermarket has just had a major renovation and extension this year. It has made a world of difference to the shopping experience. The shop has physically got larger but it also feels a lot more spacious. Besides the food section they've added sections for clothing homeware and entertainment. They've also revamped their seafood butchers and bakers' counters. For example I was intrigued to see mussels available fresh on the rope still in water. There are a variety of ways to pay - at a cashier self scan and a novel method I've not seen elsewhere - you pick up a hand held scanner which you carry round the shop with you and scan items as you go along. At the counter you pay what it says on the hand held scanner. They do random spot checks on this method to make sure peop,5,8,8/18/2010,OapLWhQI4Gm32nYbHmUA,754,1693,0

With an 8:00 pm reservation and the two hours that followed were indulgent alluring and at some points just a little bit weird but in a good way! Dinner consisted of about 15 courses and of the 15 I would say about 3 of them were dessert-y. I don't want to give any spoilers so I won't go into too much detail although I understand that new courses come out all the time! Basically what you are in for is a culinary and sensory treat.  Touch smell sight taste and scent are all engaged by the offerings at moto. What I like is that they are playful most of the food is delicious and they offer a multi-way deconstruction of simple notions that some of us may have about particular dishes. Some of the offerings are more conceptual when you think about them so def,4,2,11/15/2011,O46R1fsVyNVKkJIDmjFqg,16,385,1

The pharmacy is fast and efficient and the staff here is typically friendly. What drives me nuts is that this place is always very disheveled looking.

The odd thing is I think their regular pizza is just okay and eating there feels like I'm in a cafeteria more than a restaurant.  I'm sure it would be great for a bunch of kids after a baseball or soccer game but a little loud for me.  I agree with Patrick the onions are awesome but my future experiences with Mama's will be getting a gluten free pizza for the wife and onion rings for me.,3,0,7/15/2011,1GDNImiyd4NnzuDAs3v0Q,10,65,0

It was a little loud in the bar as there was live music so we ate in the restaurant and it was a bit quieter. Mom had calamari (good) and an antipasto salad. The salad was HUGE and loaded with meats and cheeses. I had the Gino's special steak which is a fillet with blue cheese. The salad was quite large and a bit watery. The creamy garlic dressing was tasty but there was not enough of it. The steak was nice and cooked rare as requested. The double baked potato was just okay large but not very flavorful. The decent house wine was $5 a glass - a bargain. I'd try Gino's again but think there are better steak houses in the south burbs.,3,3,6/13/2009,sj6MuZEA5TolYn2acfaXQ,83,293,0

This place is big so it's far for the wait staff to get to you therefore the service is slow.. Not the waitstaff's fault. Appetizers were ok and the ambience is that of an Irish bar so it is fitting.

SERVICE:  was decent though not memorable. LOCATION/AMBIANCE:  is alright.  They are located along the main Asian/Vietnamese drag in Houston Bellaire Blvd which makes things convenient.  Inside the dining area is fairly limited and during a rush you may be asked to share a table with strangers due to space shortages.  It seems pretty new and clean inside.

I think it's a big hit with the office crowd as they sell themselves as healthy steamed food (which I don't understand as you're still eating a huge tube of rice beans and meat).  The portions are big and filling - but you would expect that for $7-$8 per burrito. I've never tried their wet burritos before as I usually only come here when I want some quick and filling when I'm on the move.  But as far as faux Mexi chains go the otherwise average Taco Del Mar solidly beats Steamrollers in burrito quality and value.

0SA7A0t0vmuOgoFpjVWZ1Q,PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,The other reviews on Christies  do a great job of discussing the fact that the food here is incredible. Here's my two cents: 1. The owner is very clear that this a bar with food NOT a restaurant. It's tiny so parties of 8 are going to wait a long time. It's best for groups of 4 or less. 2. Sit at the bar. Unlike other places where eating at the bar is punishment for not making a reservation Christies bar is the place to be. 3. If you don't want to talk to the people across to you or next to you dont come. After a few beers Christies turns into a giant dinner party. 4. The kitchen is one person and your food will come out when it's ready. Enjoy a few drinks and settle in. It's worth it. 5. If meatloaf is one of the specials get it. Carrot cake too. 6.

I usually swing by here for a cup of coffee or a mocha before catching my 10:40pm train home. I'll be a little upset at times because they have a tendency of cleaning out their coffee urns way before the closing time and I'm stuck with getting something other than coffee.

I've tried Lin's and China Palace (both in Kernersville) but both seem to fall short on the food.  Lin's has some very sweet Crab Rangoon and sweet 'n sour sauce.  It tastes like candy.  B,4,5,5/12/2010,GCm8Evatg1JVje1SJkFA,40,106,0

The fact that this is downtown means that the cafe is inevitably always packed so if you want to sit and read with your drink you'll have to settle for the floor (I've seen people do this but seeing as how I'm usually wearing a skirt or a dress I haven't been able to join them).

How does one say 'no' to Firebirds? Great ambiance extremely attentive staff and great food for the win! We arrived;  greeted and seated immediately - you almost feel as if they roll out the red carpet when you arrive and leave. I forget our waiters name but he was awesome. Firebirds has an extremely lengthy wine selection - which we decided against and stuck to every southerners favorite - sweet tea (;-D). We both ordered the Cilantro-grilled chicken breast w/ smoked tomato jack cheese sauce & Parmesan mashed potatoes. There was absolutely nothing wrong with it.

They're now open from 8 AM to 1 PM and closed on Sundays which can make it a challenge for those that don't work/live in the area but certainly worth it if you're in that neck of the woods. They've also stopped serving pho so their menu is a bit more limited these days. Still the people working here are very friendly the prices can't be beat and they make a mean croissant. The fact that a number of area restaurants buy their bread here is not surprising it's worth a stop just to pick up a couple of their small baguettes.,4,1,4/2/2012,Cu9HRGNj7EJH3bTA8xSwYQ,23,190,0

Anne Marie set out a glass full of mixed peanuts for me to munch on. Afterwards I had a Sam Adams beer.

I got the seafood platter as the entree which consisted of the halibut salmon and a crab cake.  All were cooked perfectly - not undercooked or overdone.  I think my favorite was the crab cake.  The fish were cooked well but didn't have a distinct flavor at least with the seasoning.  Salmon always has a distinct taste but I wanted the seasoning to complement it and I think this was missing for both the salmon and the halibut.   For dessert we had the blueberry cannoli and the banana cream pie - I think,4,2,9/12/2011,NnrCwpS1i5mZtkGGzmIk0g,22,246,1

0tHkU1n8d4ORDBPOC0rK6g,1iJ4HoDOGSeIdyZQG6Qzww,Noodles and Company is a great choice for a quick quality meal.  It is a great place for any vegetarian to frequent as all dishes are available as vegetarian and they offer tofu as an add on.   Tonight we visited the store on Westnedge Ave in Portage MI.  This store was packed tonight and other restaurants in the same strip mall were empty...that is a good sign.   My favorite dish which I had tonight again is the Pad Thai.  I get sauteed beef added to it.  They beef was plentiful and cooked to tender perfection.  The rice noodles carrots peanuts scrambled eggs bean sprouts tamarind and cilantro in this dish are a great combination.  It is so good that it makes it difficult to order other things.   Tables are always clean.  Another plus for the budget conscious is the frequent eate,4,6,1/30/2010,1iJ4HoDOGSeIdyZQG6Qzww,83,192,0

I didn't try most of the food that was served (barbeque? usually risky for GF).  But the cobb salad and cole slaw were really excellent.

I subbed in a side salad in lieu of potato chips for a somewhat healthy option. It was just what I needed after a long day on the beach!

The first thing that I noticed when we walked in is that the place is starting to look run down. The bar especially. Dirty paint fans light fixtures all dirty & dusty. Old greasy paint on the walls. The bar itself needs refinishing. Not a very comfortable place to hang out and drink. The rest of the restaurant was a little better. The food. Same menu same standards. We had a decent meal. Pizza pasta salads it was all fine. Service was just okay.

We were sat right away and our server took our drink order for a large pitcher of sangria right away. We decided to try one cold tapas (griled asparagus) one hot (short ribs) and one order of paella. The sangria fresca was amazing on a blazing hot night and we started in on that right away. The asparagus came and was freshly grilled and by that I mean hot and not chilled. It was still delicious that way but should maybe be moved to the hot section of the menu. We did only get 4 small spears for $5.50.

Coffee was a chore. Had lobster ravioli as an appetizer; average. The sauce seemed leftover and I could detect some added wine. The lobster was chewy as were the shrimp that are in the dish. The entre was linguini with white clam sauce. A specialty of this place is gluten-free pasta. I'll have to say that with a name like al dente you would expect perfect pasta-- to the tooth is the literal translation. Not here. It was slightly overdone but not soggy. There were added chopped clams and perhaps seven-eight nice juicy ones. The clam broth was good and garlicky but otherwise unremarkable.

The Fairlawn location located right near 77 is the only location in NE Ohio. The place is very clean and organized looking. There is an ample amount of tables making good use of a somewhat small space. I ordered the Baja Burrito with chicken as well as guacamole & chips. The guacamole was not the best I've ever had but it was edible. The chips were really good salty and crispy the way a tortilla chip should be. The burrito had chicken Pico de Gallo guacamole & cheese. It was a pretty good sized burrito a lot bigger than the picture made it out to be. I thought it was pretty good.

0u8LgrQFVf3gllBFDoPQ,bpf34V4QGtJjumrVPvhK8A,If Yelp had more than 5 stars the Point would get all of them on my review! I frequently go to Phoenix about once or twice each year. My first time there a family member recommended that if I was looking to stay somewhere other than his house to stay at this Pointe. I did it and I haven't stayed anywhere else since then. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The balconies and patios are very secure and private. The staff is amazing and the resort is very quiet and comfortable. I can't decide what the resort has more of though great views parking spaces or pools! Everywhere you turn there is a beautiful relaxing pool and hot tub on this resort. The place is just great for everyone! I had taken my wife and we had a great stay. Recommended it to colleagues or customers and they,5,3,12/12/2011,bpf34V4QGtJjumrVPvhK8A,4,121,0

Because I'm not a huge football fan I was a little skeptical of going to a baseball game. I didn't know if I would be bored like I was during football games (I like watching them on TV but in person...it just takes so...long). I had been to a Cardinals game before in St. Louis and really liked it but had never been to a Royals game before this summer. One thing I really like about Kauffman is the fact that they have really fun events and giveaways. Almost every week there is something sweet to get as you pass through the front gate whether it be a free bobblehead of one of the players a t-shirt or something for the kiddies.

I understand the sentiment that Amici Milano is trying to be something that it's not - a more upscale fancier Italian restaurant. Despite its best efforts the plastic flowers all over the walls year-round indoor Christmas lights decorating entrance ways and wait staff mispronouncing the dinner specials don't quite convince me. I stuck to the basics with food getting the manicotti. It was generous for the price esp since it came with salad (not good) and raspberry sorbet for palette cleansing (cool!) but the food was nothing to write home about. Fairly average maybe slightly better than I could've cooked up in my own kitchen. So in conclusion: meh. It's nice that they try but I'm uni,2,0,8/11/2010,rEpkLONhLOSwGqs7ZnVZWA,3,75,0

Everything here is leather + Italian made mostly in Florence and colored using natural vegetable dyes. What sets his store apart from literally hundreds of other spots selling similar styles at similar prices is that the overall quality is a bit better (check stitching and hardware) and the owner was really helpful + friendly.

That is a cool enough deal but I felt like the jewelry was pricey for the quality. Some of the earrings can be bought on Buford Highway or at Just The Thing for half the price.

This event caters to the true beer drinking crowd meaning that you're going to find many more of the small and obscure breweries in attendance than you would at any of the other local tasting events.

This is highly approachable food with a culinary flair. As I write this review I am craving the beefsteak mini-burgers! Waldy's lamb chops are second to none grilled with delicious wood flavor. The roasted leg of rabbit is also a crowd pleaser. If you like seafood the trout is a definite must. I love the room with a wide-open middle and balconies all around. There's a large private room above the kitchen ideal for parties or large events.

0UzjOjbc5gIsNZ8mpQQ,f1MFQxTZAWJnRQdrouLgA,I came here yesterday to get some work done trying to avoid the office on my day off. As far as a coffee shop goes it definitely met all of my needs. The coffee is very good and the ladies behind the counter were quite friendly. They had a variety of teas as well. All pretty standard coffee house fare but that's exactly what I needed. It seems that they were serving sandwiches that looked good however smaller than what I'm used to eating. But then again the girl behind the counter was skinnier than me so maybe I need to rethink my food portioning. Ambiance...hmmmm where do i begin. The tables are fine. Comfortable  with plenty of work space and lots of natural light.

Not a lot of places carry these until you hit Il. They have hot items: - egg rolls - burritos - chicken And other fast to go type food. They had 3-4 pizzas that actually looked decent for a convenient store. Seems handy for the truckers. .55 for ice. Really?

Now onto the positives the rooms are very large and well kept and the bathrooms are amazing (yes the tub is as big as everyone claims). The room service was more than accommodating with our sleep schedule and never failed to come less than twice a day regardless of irregularity in times. The Wynn Casino is also one of the best yes it is a little pricey but the drink service makes up for it (at least I think so). The pool is awesome I recommend the adult/euro pool.

A couple months ago we ate at Mama's pizza on Rice Street a place that I hold dear to my heart. They suggested a similar place just south of Lake Nokomis so we all came to see what the fuss was about. I find it hard to judge pizza because there are so many varieties that they just don't compare well. I think Fat Lorenzo's has the best overall hand tossed pizza in the metro. They have the best crust that I've ever tasted on a hand-tossed pizza. Some people leave the last crusts to their pizza but to do so here would be a crime. It is better than most places bread sticks very airy and chewy. They also have the best mozzarella cheese that I've tasted. And they do NOT skimp on the cheese.

His Jeep had just been fixed and of course something started scraping horribly... like makes-your-teeth-hurt scraping. Yikes. We he first heard it he was closest to NTB so he went inside for a quote. They told him that caliper on the left side was broken and basically he's been driving with his brakes squeezed onto his wheel. Quote? $700. Why? They were telling him that they had to replace his brakes in pairs. Westown lifted his Jeep up saw that his right side was in perfect condition and actually offered to fix what *only* needed it.

Part of the great convenience is if you park at Tower City there is an indoor walkway to take you from the mall to the main entrance of the arena all without stepping outside. There is a pretty good selection of food available although I didn't eat any of it. My biggest complaint is that getting around is extremely confusing especially if you are on a different level than the floor you enter on.

Comfort food at a reasonable price is generally going to be popular but it's somewhat ubiquitous and I haven't come across anything on their menu that is breaking any molds.

The smoked ribs while fairly flavorful and moderately tender have a faint amount of smoke flavor but no discernible smoke ring in the meat.

0VSmpLSCmknOJsCxRNb7XQ,lUAEesLvvNUAYqqkxLFpgQ,My husband and I came with a Travelzoo voucher.  Here's what we ordered: Appetizers: Mesquite grilled shrimp with coconut curry aioli and endive marmalade - giant tasty shrimp cooked perfectly with amazing sauces and seasonings. Mussels with chorizo and asparagus - flavors/seasonings were delicious and very tasty but size of mussels were very small though and the bread that came w/ the mussels were super hard from being toasted too long. Entrees: Seared duck breast with chorizo and forbidden black rice risotto - duck breast was completely raw in the middle but sides were amazing. Braised short ribs with white polenta and pistachio crumble - tender juicy flavorful and no complaints here. Desserts: Opera cake with egg nog ice cream and almonds - cake was too rich and dry but the egg nog,3,0,7/27/2012,lUAEesLvvNUAYqqkxLFpgQ,7,201,0
0VUdg9Qn732ugGRphhOZnw,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,It's been a long time since I've stepped into a dollar store. It might actually be a few years since my last visit but I digress. I came here in search of cheap garbage bags. Across the street at Walgreen's I couldn't find anything less than $5 and since I'm a little low on cash from my move every penny counts. This was apparently an Eckerd that has been converted into a Dollar General. The selection was a lot larger than I expected although there isn't much for a buck (most things are a little more pricey but not expensive). I found my trash bags AND got some dishwasher gel tabs for about $2 less than I usually pay. The variety of name brands was much more than I expected and the prices are low so I'll probably be back in the future for more household needs.,4,2,12/7/2008,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,270,932,0

I had a stuffed pork chop stuffed w/ prosciutto and fresh mozzarella cheese. The chops were huge!

The server said Oh there is a sign in the front that says we aren't taking gift cards...""   Well we looked for the sign and guess what?  It was not on either of the double sets of doors when you walk in.  It was a plain paper sign attached to the cash register.  Now who the hell is looking there when you walk in?  Can somebody say lame??  I can.  LAME!

I asked about when did the Ocean Seafood place disappear - he said it was about 4 months ago. Oh well. I ordered a half Peruvian chicken with Yuca and a bottle of cold water. While I was waiting I eyeballed the place. It's a bit of an odd configuration. There is no barrier between the kitchen equipment and the small dining area.

I had made a mental note that we really needed to try to come during an off time (do they really have off times?) I found myself with a day off during the middle of the week.  The weather was amazing and we felt like going down to walk by the river.  Suddenly a pizza from Supino's popped into my head.  Reading a few reviews from Yelp was all it took to convince my dear hubby that we needed to hop in the car right away and drive here as quickly as we could.

I don' t know if it is just me - but the staff at South Point - in all the venues except Stake 'n Shake - seem to have low energy focus and are generally just very pedestrian - certainly nothing special. Was surprised to find that the washcloths left in the bathroom had holes worn in them!  I would think they'd watch for things like that!  The towels were more Motel 6 quality.   For room security sometimes at night the security guard before you get to the room elevators would check for room keys and sometimes not.  It seemed to be based on mood.

Their cheese cakes are to die for and can't forget the $3 buck Chuck. I don't think I've ever spent more than $40 there and you can bring your own bags which is super earth friendly. I love people watching there too. You will see many different ages races or genders of people while you are sipping your coffee that they serve fresh everyday. However their produce section is less to be desired. I will travel elsewhere for those items. Their bread section is great and you can get a baguette for $1.00 The store is a tad too small and you have to constantly navigate around people in the store and in the parking lot.

I don't think we'll ever truly understand the primal connection between a girl and her shoe hoard but it is something to be marveled at. This past weekend while visiting my G-ma in Naperville I ran across this gem in a small strip between Starbucks and Penzey's Spices. Not one to pass up the chance to gawk at shoes (and in search of store that sold Toms in beast size) I stopped in. A simple classic room with shoes. Everywhere. On tables in the middle. On walls. On the floor. In the front window. The man working was extremely friendly and informed me that all wall sandals were 76% off! Secretly my mind had made the decision for me that we were not leaving without a pair. He wasn't pushy and just chatted me up while I wandered. Toms come in size 11 (hell yeah!) a,5,2,7/5/2011,jTlvFiQAtzGlb7QjARHnQ,50,168,0

That being said the time I was here was actually quite enjoyable.  Before the night had started I thought I had to fake having fun because we were going here for a friend's birthday but as I said I did enjoy it.  The music selection wasn't bad.  I'm not saying it was good because top 40 is still an abomination.  Cute girls behind the bar was a plus.   And yes yes yes good golly Miss Molly they had free breakfasts on Saturday night.  Eggs potatoes grits BACON!!  All the free bacon I wanted.  Went oh so well with my gin and tonic.,4,0,11/11/2011,gs4muQzzXOQgUxeNTHUgw,10,87,0

First I did not receive their bill and I called my insurance company who told me that they just received it as well and it looked like the office staff of RiverCrest had forgotten to send the bill.  Next I called Rivercrest and spoke with someone in their office and asked why this bill for a visit 6 months previous was just being sent now and they got real nasty. When I called the billing staff to inquire about my bill they had the opportunity to find out why I did not pay it - because they didn't send it and I didn't receive it.  If they would have said oh we will send you the bill I would have paid it.  Instead they got,1,3,6/4/2012,AX6TWJtUn0UXKROrR7ZdAw,133,287,0

Here are the reasons: 1) The outside of the building was remodeled and on consequence it has lost it's old-school charm. 2) The brisket was extremely EXTREMELY dry. Words cannot describe how dry this meat was. This was absolutely never the case at AB's. It does not take much of an expert to see how dry this brisket was. Much less if you taste it notice the feel of sand paper going down your throat. Considering that I brought a serious BBQ connoisseur with me this was very embarrassing and disappointing. 3) The portion sizes are nowhere what they used to be.

The waitress would come by ask if we wanted coffee and then we would not see her for about 15 minutes. I ordered corned beef hash and eggs.

The room was large but had an awkward set-up.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that my room was not upgraded but it didn't seem to flow well.  Outlets were not strategically placed by the bedstand and the TV was tiny old-school and so far away from the bed I could barely see it.  The room,4,5,4/19/2011,dIIKEfOgo0KqUfGQvGikPg,260,1215,0

Unfortunately this time around the sheen that I had with the first visit kind of seems a little more transparent the second time around. The plusses? The portions are huge! And the family-style option is a great deal (basically $20 a person for more food than you're going to eat).   Some of the dishes were pretty good but others were just blech. The gyro appetizer needed something anything to make a plate of meat taste more appetizing.  On the other hand the grilled octopus was a big hit with my dinner guests.   The flaming cheese while cool is just kind of melted cheese.

The pork chops were about like those at home only way more expensive. No the real charm here is the history and for that I think our visit to The Pirate's House was worth it. As a guy I wasn't drawn in by the Jack Sparrow impersonator who spent most of his time flirting with the ladies.

Honestly most of it was ice. 2 sips later it was empty. 2 Turkey Club Sandwiches that were honestly nothing to write home about @ 12.95 a piece. Fries were an extra charge and were not steak fries as described. Another person in our party found 2 hairs in her meal. When she showed our server she just said oh no and walked away.

Second I have food allergies which makes dining out challenging. Third I love that they have just plain regular brown rice--which is GOOD as well. I am giving this place 5 stars because they always deliver a great product and excellent customer service.  Every person on the waitstaff I've encountered takes my allergy seriously and takes extra caution to ensure I am not served something that will cause me to stop breathing.   I love that you can pick your own veggies for your stir fry.  I have tried other things on the menu but this is my standard go-to every time we go.   I also enjoy watchin,5,0,4/12/2012,Mna6U7kUX36l8dpDtUA,8,102,0

I ended up getting a more hibachi style entree and it was huge!! Chicken served with veggies rice (steamed or fried) and noodles. I of course had to get a to-go box. I will say there were more onions than green veggies but it was still very good.

The beer selection is certainly respectable. I was surprised to find that they had some Hopcat beers. I didn't realize they brewed their own in addition to the many others on tap. But a closer inspection revealed that they were styles that I wasn't really interested in. Well except for the IPA which they were out of at the time. I liked the concentration on the Michigan craft brewers but they somehow didn't seem to have a lot of my favorites.

In thinking about this review I realized how many times I've eaten here and I am really embarrassed.  I think part of the reason is that I have a number of vegetarian friends and it seems like this is one place in town we can go for a meal where they don't have to order the same thing every time to avoid eating an animal.  My frequent visits here should be further evidence that you probably shouldn't ever take my reviews seriously.,3,3,2/9/2008,h5bfJtPqCAQ0G0ozj4Dbcg,136,269,0

Yes the lobby is grand and ornate and takes you back in time but then you walk through a set of doors and BAM you're in the middle of a C- tourist-trap mall. You have to walk through that and through a gate to get to where all of the rooms are and suddenly the environment is crappy ass 80s convention hotel.

I found the sushi to be extremely good and fresh. The workers were very nice and the smoothies were to die for! I had a tapioca smoothie with pineapple and coconut. It was excellent. If you stick to the regular sushi and don't get fancy their rates are very affordable and the food is definitely worth it. Even if you go with the fancy ones you still are getting a great deal.

What is surprising is how atrocious their website is.  My hometown paper in a town of 5000 people has a better designed website with more content than http://www.omaha.com .  This fact is significantly more embarrassing given the fact that Lincoln's paper has a pretty fantastic website that's interesting and easy to navigate and has more than three stories posted on it at once.,3,1,2/18/2008,h5bfJtPqCAQ0G0ozj4Dbcg,136,269,0

We had a tough time finding it because I didn't realize that it was inside of the Comfort Inn hotel. It was such a strange location. When we walked in it didn't even seem like a restaurant. It was more like an abandoned lobby or something that they equipped with old conference room chairs. It was very strange to say the least. The menu was really big and it seemed to be very geared to different Asian ethnicities which was pretty interesting to read.

I had the tri tip and rib combo; which is not on the combo menu.  You basically order the tip and add a 1/2 slab.  Both meats lacked any flavor.  The tri tip was not slicedbut presented as a slab of beef.  I had some but it really had no flavor; so about 1/3 was left on the plate.  The 1/2 slab was actually  in two portions which I assumed they gathered from the leftovers in the kitchen; bot,2,2,9/13/2012,0L4WNYQ6f6y6pMYzJ3b9Q,14,273,0

I'm sure there's at least a hearty soup I'll enjoy. I did find the hot tea oddly disappointing. The tea bag was of just about the lowest quality and the tea had almost no flavor.

0wpvHMT5qsilLpCS1K8BA,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,After partaking in several Boondocker's Taco Tuesdays a coworker suggested Cappy's for their Taco Wednesdays.  I'd probably never have gone if this friend wasn't a regular there.  It definitely seems like the kind of bar where you'd maybe feel more comfortable going in if you knew someone.   But it seems that they treat their regulars (and those of us who come in with them) like family.  I need to learn more about this place... because all I know now is they do a gut-busting dual-taco-as-big-as-a-plate special (which includes a drink) for about $6 on Wednesdays.  But they don't' have them every Wednesday so calling ahead helps.  They don't skimp on the meat either it's just not that kind of place.  These things were so monsterous I could only eat one.,3,2,10/15/2009,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0
0wq5nosvhD2ydpLFqq8EA,fa9j21MqPDeVFzdpgWR9g,YES. An honest-to-god corner liquor store with the full authentic atmosphere right off the Lafayette upscale shopping strip. I'm surprised the city fathers haven't gotten outraged and tried to force it to convert into a wine bar. As soon as you walk in you are served notice that this place is NO JOKE. Bare concrete floor. Malt liquor straight ahead. Hardcore porn for sale right out in the open. I guess they've got a pretty good selection of regular groceries and food for a convenience store probably twice that of a typical 7-Eleven but that's kind of secondary. For beer and cigarettes and junk food and whatever other low-budget stuff that's no good for you chances are they've got what you want and at a pretty decent price. So glad they have this place.,5,0,2/16/2012,fa9j21MqPDeVFzdpgWR9g,12,203,0

As of today 8/10/07 this hotel appears to be completely remodeled.  I have been told by the front desk that all rooms are remodeled.   What gives this place 5 stars is the spaciousness and appointments in the rooms.   These rooms have the space of a luxury condo. you could easily hold a party of 10-15 in one of these rooms.....ummm but I don't think the management would like that...unless they were all staying at different rooms of the hotel. Staff gets 5 stars...more if there were more stars available.   Extremely friendly attentive and knowledgeable.   They all clearly enjoy working here. Only downside here ..so far as I can tell..are the tables...they look like an IKEA showroom...but the tables are v,5,1,8/10/2007,qgbbuhfSkH5Tna5t9tEA,160,279,1
1Chx4xfj8DJKVUjlS6Q,tnYgf3Hdx8Majujbfa8Pag,I think this is now my third review of a downtown Philadelphia hotel. So far I have liked the Philadelphia Marriott the best.  It is certainly more upscale than the Courtyard or Sheraton (both within walking distance of here) that I have previously stayed in. The room was clean but the double-beds are a bit small for 2 people.  I prefer 2 Queens to 2 Doubles.  When traveling as a family it does get crowded.  Perhaps there were rooms with queen beds as an option but the one we had wasn't one of them.  Other reviewers have mentioned that there isn't coffee in the rooms - well there is but you have to know where to look.  Who would think to look in the dresser/cabinet under the TV for the coffee maker?  I'm sure not many people.  We found it on our second morning.

The inside was pretty crowded. Not necessarily because it was bustling with people. No. It had a LARGE sushi-like bar dominating most of the space and tables crammed around it. We chose to sit in the back of the restaurant away from the door and bar where we might enjoy a constant temperature and quiet conversation. The server gave us a pot of tea and no water. We ordered Orange Chicken Mongolian Beef and Henry's Special Chicken.  The portions were huge and served family style. The three of us were able to eat some of everything and still have over half to bring home. The Orange Chicken was the best but had a thick syrupy sauce.

But when it came to the shoes? That is different.  As usual I used to buy shoes here when they had their annual bi annual whatever  annual sales.  You know where they have the big racks of shoes up and we women go in there as if foraging for food for the village.   I don't think I have ever bought a pair of shoes full price here I've always waited for the sales.  They have a few upper end brands  the usual suspects and their own brand and as with other stores - if they don't have it  they will try and hunt it down for you.,3,0,7/9/2011,dk5yqirSwDH7Cpp52NdhUA,35,302,0

The bread is to die for.  Some people just don't get it but the soft and sweet bread is reason enough to eat here.  All the sandwiches are made on the bread!  Try the Gondola; it even refrigerates well just remove the lettuce in advance.  The Pizza Bread is also delicious. One of the best things is the Spaghetti feast.  Though a small spaghetti is probably enough for the average adult who can resist unending bowls of deliciousness?!?  I will warn that Avanti's is an acquired taste.  The noodles are buttery and the sauce isn't t,3,0,1/21/2012,g37YWmgPcJI9bfkPV2Og,5,179,0

So I have two Queen beds instead of one King.   The A/C repair guy has been here - because the room was set on 52 degrees when I walked in - and he left his styrofoam cup and candy wrappers on the window sill.   The front desk staff was lackluster and I hope the young limo driver got a date from the clerk who was not helping me - because the story he was telling her at the top of his lungs in the lobby kept me from hearing most of what she said,2,2,8/22/2012,IsP4AeKFhDGRX2dx5nHVw,3,20,0

I asked how the Steak Burrito was - she replied it was very good. So I ordered the Steak Burrito with everything and a Corona. A small basket of chips were brought out for me with some salsa - the salsa was not very spicy so I added a good bit of Cholula sauce to the salsa.

My excuse was that I had signed up with a secret shopper organization and was getting a $40 gift card for my trouble. I figured I'm reviewing things anyway might as well receive some remuneration right? One of the rules was I had to go for dinner at a particular time and apparently 6:00 p.m. was when everyone in the world came downtown to hit the after-Christmas sales. I was not thrilled to wait an hour for a table but rules are rules. The nice lady at the hostess desk informed me that the buzzer would not work outside the restaurant. She did not inform me that the upstairs cafe -- with its shorter menu and shorter wait -- was an option.  I had to figure that out on my own.

It's a cheeseburger. That's about it. I wish I could point out something wrong with it or something extraordinarily good but it was just a decent burger. Service was lackluster. We saw our waitress when we ordered got our food and paid. She never checked to see if we wanted refills on our drinks or to see how our food was. This review honestly depresses me to write.

They close pretty early - I believe 7:00 weekdays and 5:00 or 6:00 on Sunday. They started out with very good prices but have been gradually jacking them up ever since. They just went through another round of price increases in some cases 50%. Time to start taking away stars; they used to be a 4 now they're a 3. Still somewhat better prices than Safeway but if they even start approaching that level this will be 1 star faster than you can say rocks and blocks.""""",3,0,9/1/2012,fa9j21MqPDeVFzdpgWR9g,12,203,0

The place holds the design of the memorial site and it covers the events as they happened on 9/11 with pictures. They have some artifacts on display made out of steel from WTC towers. It is very touching to see all those pictures and they also have few phone call conversations(recordings) between the family and their loved ones.

We got a great rate at this hotel through a corporate booking we have access to (about $100/night) and it was a pretty decent play to stay. The staff was nice and we got upgraded to a suite for no extra charge. There was a really nice TV in the room and everything was clean and looked nice. The bed was really comfy- I got the best night of sleep I've ever gotten in a hotel.

Attached to the pharmacy is a small market that has a decent selection of kosher foods as well as a deli counter and some prepared foods selections.  I sampled some of their hawaiian salad and it wasn't that great... Overall I wish they had a full meat counter or offered more Jewish deli foods but it's not a bad neighborhood place to shop especially if you just need a few items.

The hours on the Wachovia website don't match the actual hours posted on the door here.  That's kinda frustrating especially since when I went I had to use the drive-thru and prefer coming inside for service. If I had my way they'd either close this branch and expand the hours at one down the street or make it bigger and more user friendly.  I guess we'll see what happens when it becomes a Wells Fargo later this year.,3,1,9/9/2010,NZbaQFp10iF77CTQt24Q,270,932,0

Mind you it was very good but I was not impressed.  The soup I had was absolutely delicious the broth tasty and the medium level of spice I chose gave off the perfect amount of heat.   The rest of the meal however didn't do much for me.  The Basil Chicken had one Basil leaf.  One?  I adore Basil and would have loved to have more.  I also tried my husbands curry and something was missing.  It was a bit bland even through the high spice level if that makes sense. Prices were definitely good and the service excellent.  Maybe another dish will wow me like the soup did. Next time.  I look forward to,3,1,4/20/2010,Ai7ZSET9dbLh1qUdcyC5Q,316,1146,0

I was instantly greeted by Adrian.  I found him both helpful polite and genuine.  Not only did I get my red shirt I spent $200 on jeans and other shirts as well.  Although I may not return to the Express in Miami I most certainly would return to this one - mainly because of the outstanding service I received this day from Adrian in particular!

Roses has better items and prices than Dollar General but not as good as Walmart.  What they do have is extremely affordable.  An okay few time use men's suite is $25 in more than 10 colors.  You can get the shirt and tie to go with for $10.  Even their small items are at a better price for example any size of aluminum disposable cooking pan is only a $1.   This location is super convenient on the main drag across from Food Lion.

You won't get the personalized service or shopping here but there are deals to be had if you are patient. I like the few items made specifically for Rack some great fitted t's and cardigans too. But as I said it is the denim that makes this place great IMO.  Paige jeans and Seven for All Mankind under $100?  I mean really those wear like steel and are flattering to boot.

At $13 a bottle it's my go-to choice now. The store is laid out in a super cool way. It's really easy to find what you're looking for and the tasting panels they offer is such a neat idea.

Out in the middle of nowhere in NW Indiana just outside the town limits of North Judson IN lays a pretty large warehouse. Inside this warehouse you will find a veritable plethora of deals.

We've never experienced a bad evening except at times the servers are a bit hasty at times and not as engaging because they're very busy. The bar is definitely a little tight and you tend to forget there are couches at the back and some dart boards. Come here to just hang out and know that it might take a while for you to get a server on a busy night. It's good  to people watch around the Shops area. Other than that there's really nothing worth mentioning except you get your beer you sit down and chat with your friends and you get out.,3,0,8/12/2012,gWrfDg971GtQVVUhuUKBQ,1,123,0

There's no hot deli counter and only five isles of the trademark collections of foods that you expect as a standard offering in Trader Joe's. Still I got fresh pomagranate seeds (already expelled from the shell!) and some fantastic Italian ham and cheese specialty rolls from their deli case. And although I'm going to remain a member at the coop the amount of money I spent on this evening's grocery bill was about half of what it would have been had I gotten it there. So I am definitely a fan (where's that half-star when you need it??) just chalk it up to missing what had been available elsewhere.,4,0,2/19/2007,VbNMQwizyLjSGeS8u70XIQ,104,169,0

By supplementing our weekly grocery store trip to a trip to the Nature's Bin too I've helped get my weight under control by eating much better food. (OPINION FOLLOWS) And while organic natural foods may or may not be healthier for you I find them to be tastier than ones that are not simply because there's fewer added salts fewer mystery ingredients and no pesticides. Definite plusses in my book. You're not going to find a huge selection simply because there's not a huge selection to be had.

The downside to the house is that they still have a lot more work to do fixing it up especially outside.  Some of the windows are covered with plywood and everything needs a good scraping and a coat of paint.  If you like this kind of historical stuff check it out.  If you really want to help don't do what I did.  Go when you have to pay the $6 to get,4,0,6/4/2011,odq8SUSIT8narMOKlZrg6Q,432,926,0

It wasn't a burrito kind of night so I was a bit skeptical about ordering salad from Laughing Planet Cafe. I ordered the Fu Manchu which consisted of romaine leaf lettuce and spinach mix asian veggies (bok choy pea pods nappa cabbage carrots celery bamboo shoots green onions) slivered toasted almonds sprinkle of fried shallots and tossed in a sweet and sour sesame dressing. The price tag was $6.50. I'm happy to report that the salad was delicious. I love the crunchy combination of the veggies almonds and the dressing. However the portion was a bit small for the price tag. It didn't satisfy my craving for salad quite right.

The cashier was also so friendly during my last visit...my mom was asking her questions about the menu and this girl had some great answers. You've got to love people who find pleasure in their job. The only con I have is really for the Panera brand and not just this location. It's about the portion size of most of their meals. It's just a bit small for the prices but very delicious.

The store is a massive showroom on Dupont that's easily missable as it has no signage (each time I go at least one person getting out of their parked car asks me if I know where it is). The showroom is loaded up with gorgeous furniture that would best be suited to a large roomy space as most of it's pretty big. The kitchen tables are so big they can probably easily seat 12-15 people and they're very rustic looking. Tons of dark brown wood and leather-backed dining chairs. Huge dressers ornate chaises and bedroom sets - including an ornate goldleaf canopy bed that I've been lemming for months (minus the $2200 price tag).

Visited this lovely meat palace for the second time with the boyfriend and a few friends last Saturday and just like the first time it was abso-FREAKING-lutely DELICIOUS.  Compared to Texas de Brazil they have a wider selection of meat and their salad bar boasts such food such as oysters mushroom risotto pesto pasta salad proscuitto and much much more.  Granted Texas de Brazil does have a larger salad bar but I prefer Brazzaz's meats.  The Culotte""  (which I also believe is the house special) is my absolute favorite--it has a nice ring of fat around the edges and adds so much flavor to the already flavorful meat.  Another thing I love about this place is that they come around with pineapple skewers.  It's a nice break from the meat and they're perfectly ripe""",5,2,8/19/2012,crXbzjmEjkyyT95SAwug,4,61,0

The only fish on there was a salmon dish.  Everything else that even had seafood had shrimp in it.  The other thing that was weird was that the entrees came with sides.  But then they had a whole bunch of sides you could get separately.  But everything already came with sides!  Very confusing.

Stratosphere according to me comes in the category of the budget travelers.Though the hotels in Vegas are far more cheaper as compared to other big cities. It is located outside the main strip and away from the main action. The only reason to stay here are the cheap prices of the rooms. But again these are not the best rooms on the strip. I came here to visit some of my common friends who were staying here. The rooms are decent but some of them looked very old and worn out. If one has a designated driver and on a budget then this place is a good to stay. The best part of this hotel are the thrill rides.

The cafe can deliver some seriously great food at very low prices (especially with the employee discount) but it can also be expensive and bad at times.

The general setup is like a mini food court with a pizza station deli/sandwich station entree station (changes daily) and grab & go fridge are all priced per item which are usually pretty affordable. The salad bar & theme bar (changes daily) are both priced per pound and can can at times get very pricey depending on what you get. The drink selections are pretty poor though.

I am so appreciative and stoked that Mellow Mushroom offers up vegan cheese BBQ tofu regular tofu seitan and other veg-friendly options. However I was disappointed that this Nashville location didn't stock the seitan BBQ tofu or tofu today. I have a feeling if pepperoni was running low...this would not have happened. I also have a hunch that they may not regularly carry these items because they were circled with a purple marker in the menu too. I did order the Make Your Own Salad with the vegan cheese which was tasty. I may come back again to investigate if the other vegetarian items are really even offered up here? P.S. Our server was not very friendly either. All around a rather bland experience.,2,12,12/19/2010,5Y5KbsI5buMcNh2hTFaRpA,94,580,0

On Saturday there are WAY too many girls trying to act like they're hot shit. Literally the guy to girl ratio is about 7 to every 1 guy : not a problem for the guys but us girls would like some candy too. Drinks (as expected) are overpriced --- try $13 for a small gawdy plastic cup (not even a glass one!) however I made my way up to the bar alone one night while I was staying in the Gansevoort and made friends with the bartenders who didn't let me pay for a single drink! You guys made my night.

I will assume that is because it is fairly new. Opened in late 2011 I believe. I am not an egg person but my friends are and they say they are amazing. If you are not a fan of home fries you can ask to have regular potatoes. The hummus is good but not that large of a portion. The gyro is why I originally came to check the place out and I was not disappointed. The service was good not great. The bottomless mimosa is a bit deceiving as they are not actually bottomless. There is outdoor seating but it oversees the parking lot and Height Blvd so it's not that great of a view. The place is great for large groups though.,4,1,3/11/2012,7ZGG0zAaJAyymNnugTsqzA,2,85,0

The walking tour always starts at some meeting point and lasts a few hours.  They walk you through a couple of neighbourhoods of Paris giving you fun commentary about Paris highlighting major landmarks along the way.  Part way into the day there is a stop at a restaurant/bar/shop to get some food before the tour continues.  At the end of the tour you tip your guide what you think the tour is worth and you're on your way to explore Paris some more!   I always recom,5,0,12/20/2011,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJtg,157,605,0

Fit for Life is a sandwich and wrap place where you can also purchase combo's with soup and salad. It definitely is on the pricier side with a soup combo setting you back 8 - 10 bucks with tax but worth it.

It's got inner city flair sports team hats on the wall who-knows-how-old fixtures (that are very very comfortable) and seventies wood panelling.

I think it closes at 6 or 7pm during the week meaning dinner is an impossibility. The only time I've been able to visit has been for brunch - they really should consider improving their hours on weeknights especially considering that Ossington has become a hotspot for evening activity with all the new restaurant and bars opening recently. Having said that brunch was amazing. Believable vegan cheese in a black bean and sweet potato burrito with rice that was super filling.

The have an awesome selection of rolls as was surprised to see more than just one vegetarian item. They have sushi lunch combo's along with cheap rolls-most were in the $6-$10 range I dig that. Service was pretty beat this time around-it could be because of the influx of people out for lunch or NCAA crowd but it was pretty bad.

Even though it was well past the lunch hour and almost into happy-hour the place was still nearly full. I'm not sure if that's exceptional for a Thursday or not. There were four of us and after we were initially seated at a table near the door - with very close proximity to both a major traffic aisle and the table next door - we opted to sit at the bar instead. Great choice because the bartender was very friendly and offered great recommendations for lunch (fish tacos... mmm). Plus it gave me a chance to oogle the blown-glass beer taps and gaze into the inner-workings of the tiny bar and kitchen.

17c6Wz7HzkSLh20UDTZQ,9VDrCkfj0IMDSDPgsPKFA,Bona Terra has been open a long time and truly has become a Pittsburgh classic.  I have been there many times over the years and I can remember my first dinner there about 7 or 8 years ago.  The BYOB concept was so novel for Pittsburgh.  They were playing OK Computer from start to finish over the speakers.  It was quite memorable for the excellent ingredients and creative presentations. Fast forward to the present where we dined with a couple close friends on a Saturday night.  Bona Terra really hasn't changed a lot over it's time.   In many ways it has declined.  They still play great music but it's so loud inside that you can't hear it. Our party had 8:00pm reservations.  We arrived 10 minutes early and had to sit at the bar.  Because Bona Terra still doesn't have a liquor license we w,2,4,4/17/2011,9VDrCkfj0IMDSDPgsPKFA,3,51,0

Last night my girls and I had an event to go to so we went to the bar before for some pre-event cocktails.  Before the hour was up we had agreed that we would be back right after for a few more.  The drinks are a generous pour the bartenders are really nice and the manager John Lawniczak is MORE than amazing!! They have trivia Wednesdays $3 you call its on Thursday and other awesome specials throughout the week.  Great music is playing over the speakers when there's not a band and there are,5,1,8/12/2011,QR8XFFHYUX0epXOrDbrXw,35,490,0

Like I said the food isn't bad it's just not that good. I ordered the $8 lunch special today and it was good enough to hit the spot but left me with some disappointment. The rice fell right off the rolls almost immediately--like as I tried to pick them up with my chop sticks. It should have a nice sticky consistency and this rice tasted a bit old. On the other hand the veggies in the veggie roll tasted fresh and the miso soup was delish. It's just not worth the trip out here for the OK food and the horrible parking situation.

This specific location does NOT disappoint. It is literally right across the street from the famous St. Louis Arch. You cannot get any closer unless you slept in the park! One of the 'perks' of the Drury Inn is that they offer a pretty great breakfast as well as a 'happy' hour in the evening. The menu is mostly bachelor food (nachos hot dogs hamburgers) but we ate enough to skip a 'real' dinner that night. This location was also very large and offers two indoor pools.

18r0dlA6fMdCdXBMUee8aQ,SXeMGP5lNgc03z7cl9Xihg,in a nutshell...disappointing.  Four of us for lunch one craving lamb lamb kebab was donner kebab not what we wanted or expected...so used to getting chunks of lamb chargrilled it's been so long since I've had to reiterate not donner quel domage!.  The rice was bland even though it was green fresh dill would be nicer rather than dried.  One diner's salmon kebab was Ok but a little dry.  Another diner's falafal plate was OK.  The eggplant appetizer was A-OK by all of us. All four of us agreed the persian ice cream with rosewater and saffron flavor was the highlight of the meal though the squirty cream was not needed.  For some reason they put milk in the Turkish coffee and it was sweetened to the point of undrinkable.  I also like a good 1/4 of an inch of mud at the bottom of my cup ,2,1,4/27/2011,SXeMGP5lNgc03z7cl9Xihg,15,287,0

When I realized that this gigantic hotel was the one I was staying in I was pretty proud of my hotel booking skills. Now enter the hotel. Holy cow is this thing huge.

The moving sidewalks between concourses is a Chicago wannabe but succeeds anyway.  Electronic music with undulating lights behind curved glass curtains with water patterns worked in.  Thoroughly enjoyable. Concourse C is a little tired but Fuddrucker's is there to perk up the Yankee in you with its fries and burgers.  It's a teeny space which must accomodate lots of gates' travellers without substantial competition from other restos.  The bitty 2-top tables lend themselves to a lot of traveller schmoozing.  So I had my burger,4,0,7/10/2011,MInp33w5vvHeBo68BAPmgw,158,567,1

Also sometimes Fullsteam is over run by young families (with little children running amok) or douchey looking Duke professional school students.  Not a problem at Surf Club.  It's got a slightly older crowd (mid 30s) and I have not seen a single child crying or dog barking. Sometimes the bartenders can be AWOL or pissy.  One time I waited at the bar for 10 mins before the bartender showed up.  Another time the bartender seemed like he hated the world and wanted to go home & write in his diary.  But he still poured a great pour so I didn't have any beef.  In fact Surf Club i,5,4,8/23/2012,YLuB9kMNwY7T7s9PMtkwQ,26,216,0

18WCLrpCLfa6ux6WnSpig,1h1DD2hgfgud7V4NCE9mVg,I agree with the visitor from SJ. It was a big rip off. Pretty inside but the art was average and so were the performances. $22.50 a pop really? The Getty in LA is FREE and no museum in NY with quality art (where even Vancouver photographer Jeff Wall's work was exhibited) charges that much. And let's face it you can hardly compare the two cities' galleries in that respect. Quite disappointing to say the least. It was as pristine as any museum should be but that's about it. Doubt I'll be visiting for another 14 years even if to see something different.  It seems that the artists I know are in no rush to return either. I would almost rather save my money to go South for a better exhibit. No wonder rioting seems to be the activity of choice these days (sigh).,2,3,6/18/2011,1h1DD2hgfgud7V4NCE9mVg,36,420,0

We have obtained mortgages from the bank and also have used their trust department - they are very professional.  My family and I also have our checking and other deposit accounts with Palos.   If you prefer to sit down with real people who won't take advantage of you - go to Palos Bank.  If you prefer bankers who will push your grandma to an annuity salesman when she thinks she is buying a C.D. - go to most national banks.,5,4,9/5/2009,4ssDCBvb9LC2cMpWxjhpRQ,26,185,0

There is seating inside and outside on a patio overlooking the water. The employees were professional and nice although they did not service our table as one would expect. When my Orange Juice ran out the waiter never offered me more. He did the same thing to my wife. The buffet food was average at best. The selection was not small.

What I like about RT in general:  I dig the retro/contemp decor.  I love their salad bar.  Their salad bar is not all sugar-coated with things that really don't have anything to do with a salad.  If you want a good all-you-can-eat salad with all the veggies and grains RT is the place.  I like the square plates too!  This non-vegetarian restaurant has several really cool options for the vegetarian in your group.,3,0,11/21/2011,K8jpilJCv962HKTVt7VsQ,125,323,0

There are periods of 3-4 times in a row that I've visited and not found a thing. I agree with some of the yelpers that can be a little crusty-like in some areas and it seems like the kitchen wares section is way messier than it used to be. Regardless I've found antique books cool knit hats scarves 80's Browns shirts and most recently an old library table for $15. It's huge we refinished it and it's now our office desk. It looks perfectly rustic and we barely spent anything on it. Win!,4,3,10/3/2012,NfU0zDaTMEQ4X9dbQWd9A,76,440,0

The mapo tofu is tolerably spicy and makes an excellent comfort food. Need a recommendation of what NOT to order? Chow mein; you're given a bag of those small crunchy noodles used as an alternative to croutons on garden salads. This is in no way similar to the Panda Express chow mein.

Service is good and the hibachi chefs are great with kids.   Although it IS a heavy meal when our family wants Japanese steak house food we go here.,4,1,9/4/2008,58IYRjxtfE4XNUXysecdw,57,200,0

I suspected it would serve Korean food and a glance at the colourful menus on the window confirmed a full menu of Korean dishes though there is some crossover with dishes like udon noodles. This site has played host to different restaurants over the years usually of the quick and cheap oriental variety. Corean Chilli is no exception with service being brisk and even brusque if you linger a bit too long. As I'm not that familiar with Korean food I asked my waitress for recommendations.

I ordered a Gyro with french fries to go. The food was very good. They season the gyro meat when they heat it up on the griddle - something I've not seen before from other area places that serve Gyros.

I flew into SFO from Chicago and needed to make my way to way up north in Arcata CA to see my brother in time for Thanksgiving. My troubles started even before I got inside the station. Crossing the parking lot of the depot one of their uniformed employees came running up to me and started yelling at me to get out of the lot. Apparently they only want you using the sidewalks but there were no signs or chains cordoning off the area to the contrary. I turned around to go the long way but he continued to chase me until I reached the pavement. Talk about excessive. Did one of the drivers recently run over someone? One wonders!

Sides are very good and they have possibly the best wine list in town. The service is outstanding. Bottom line I am not going to Flemings for the sides and wine. I want a killer piece of steak.

The menu serves up primarily sandwiches and salads but offers a fairly wide variety of each and for the most part all those I have tried have been on point. Topping the list thus far have been the reuben (best I've come across in the Cities) shrimp po' boy portobello sandwich (agreed with past comments that the arugula was a bit overpowering) and the shrimp and asparagus salad. All sandwiches include a side of either mixed greens fries (thick-cut and full of greasy goodness) soup pasta salad or fresh fruit.

For example there are statues of poets. I don't know why. Apparently 30000 people showed up when the first American poet statue was dedicated by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877. Fitz-Greene Halleck was the poet's name. Ever heard of him? Me neither! After that they had to change the rules on public gatherings in the park since the huge crowd kinda destroyed the area.,4,1,9/17/2011,Zn8tgekH0oCfyk4SUtygoA,22,212,1

But - as is all too often the case even in modern properties in Europe - the air conditioning is weak and the self parking - shared with adjacent conference venue - is not open 24/7 which is irritating if arriving in late evening.

People were cutting each other off and as I was watching one driver of a BWI Taxi drove right up onto the hood of another car despite several long horn blasts. The yelling and screaming that ensued in the parking lot kinda made me wonder if one of them was in the other's territory.  I ended up calling the police as things escalated.

But having gone last week I have to say that I was a tad disappointed with the quality of the food. The service is still good but the food has changed for the worse. The portions are smaller - which is usually a big mistake - and not as tasty. When this place opened the portions were generous and the food tasted fresher. Now the portions are smaller the prices are the same and I feel as if the quality has dipped. I hope that they reconsider these changes because they are the only Italian eatery in the neighborhood and it is a shame that they should be associated with mediocre food.,3,1,4/9/2009,8K2thN6xtI0V1FgjOjLlQ,42,165,0

1dACWNhkesYXvJ6qtU0b9A,3zxy3LVBV3ttxoYbY4rQ8A,Let me start off by saying this was probably a 4-star stay. But considering the price paid ($169 the first night $210 the second both booked on http://hotels.com) I think it was over-priced. I mean that's not expensive but you can oftentimes snag a stay at a boutique hotel for those prices. Beds were comfy room was freezing Wi-Fi was speedy bathroom semi-spacious - great water pressure BTW. Like the majority of hotels in Austin the location was perfect.

1daNP9PFZJDBdijpemTXQ,FZTkBavnUWVQRK3ULOxePQ,Ignore the fact that this looks like a run down grocery store / gas station.  It is.   However it's the best Indian food Grocery store in Brazos Valley.   As I have been trying to refine my skills at preparing Indian food at home I have found an exceptional variety here including fresh Paneer (Indian cheese) from Dallas.   The owners wife is very helpful and even gave us some Youtube links to her favorite Indian chefs to learn from.   Two thumbs up!    This is really a hidden gem. When you go in there just ask where the Indian Grocery room is and they will show you to the back.  Might have to turn the light on.   This is totally cool.,4,7,11/22/2010,FZTkBavnUWVQRK3ULOxePQ,938,1749,0

1e1BXBHGtuhnCPjcOnXRA,puUP7otIJotqTIMCt3xWg,My frist visit to Teddy's !! I was pretty psyched to go here since I've driven past it a few times and have usually seen the parking lot packed on the weekends. This is your average bar with a dance floor thats on the smaller side and a decent amount of tables and plasmas on the wall. The drinks are pricey for what you actually get. My crown and Coke seem extremely watered down and so did the Jack. Sunrise senior living is right down the street and I think Teddy's is definitely the fav hang out spot. There are tons of cougars (not necessary the ones you would dream about) and tons of guys to take home the cougars. If your bored and don't feel like staying in the Shelby Twp are hit it up and make sure you bring your AARP card along ;),3,0,3/8/2010,puUP7otIJotqTIMCt3xWg,34,128,0

1e46WCXCuPRjXnbYl3K5Jg,4U380Xqra6lpKWZ6FoO58w,Hemet's Mimi's had two things going for it: the dinner bread selection (where they bring out an assortment of breads in a basket along with butter before your meal) and the breakfast. Last I went they changed their dinner breads slightly and they're not nearly as tasty or fresh as they once were.  What a shame because I would go there just for this (i'm a carb fanatic). So now we're down to one thing going for the restaurant. Breakfast is a deal here.  You get your entree along with a muffin of your choice all for just about $10.  Not too bad these days.  I stick to any of the omelets because it's hard to go wrong with an omelet.

Have ordered basics like egg rolls chicken and broccoli lo mein and general tso's but also went bold (for me!) and tried the wok glazed ginger with chicken. Everything was really good... it's as plain and simple as that.

The pastry crust was nice and flaky.  A very nice job on the crust.  The sago egg tart had little sago balls mixed into the custard which gave an interesting texture.  Overall the custard was a bit too sweet for my taste but a nice tart. The ginger egg custard tart was really nice.  There was a very strong natural ginger flavour.  It reminded me a bit of the ginger custard at Ho Yuen Kee (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/h…) which is one of the better desserts at Chinese restauran,4,10,10/5/2009,RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,551,1132,0

The mashed potatoes were at once fluffy and creamy the beans were perfectly flavorful and fresh and the steak was decent.

The hummus and salads are great; however the Greek salad was a huge disappointment last time.  Poor quality iceberg lettuce cucumbers and tiny green olives from a jar.   One of our entrees was a gyro which was ok - I think there are better options.  The other entree was the lamb kebob which was perfectly cooked and served with rice and stewed green beans.

It has been almost two years and some friends have recently gone and said quality control is much better. Hope to give this place another shot.,2,0,10/21/2008,Y4Du3cllZgpNjzTvmeZ0Q,206,562,0

My grandpa takes my sisters and I to lunch here every year a few days after Christmas before we wander down the gorgeous cobblestone on Main Street so it has a special place in my heart.

You can't go wrong with any of the soups and salads and the Mexican section of the menu is pretty nice... fish tacos chalupas chimichangas etc. They also have nine different burgers and the mushroom burger deserves five stars alone (it has American Swiss sauteed mushrooms caramelized onion roasted garlic mayo.

I have been coming here faithfully since my sophomore year in college in '05. It's a bit pricey but the food is delicious. My favorite dishes are: Ramen (comes with lots of meat great noodles and lots of veggies) which is very authentic Beef Udon - the flavor of the beef is perfect it is sliced thin and chewy with just the right amount of fat to melt in your mouth! Katsudon - I love the marinated beef with rice and the little pickled veggies that comes with this. Spicy Susan - great tasting sushi roll that is their house special - this isn't on their menu so be sure to ask for it! Try the Appletini a delicious apple flavored martini.

They worked very hard very fast and all with a great attitude. They arrived in plenty of time and considering we had hundreds of guests arriving at once things couldn't have went any smoother. Three stars only because I had to call three times before I could get someone to send me a quote. Each time the person would say they would send it as soon as we hung up and they never did. I finally had to call back and be a little more aggressive. I'm assuming they want as much biz as possible so why not just follow through?

Our ducks were put in a row and she was swept away for her spa day. They gave us a welcome package for us (first-timers only!) which explained their philosophy and process in detail. I was called on my cell phone when she was ready but was told not to hurry they are open until 5. I arrived to find little Izzy wrapped in a festive St. Patrick's day bandana and bow on her harness.

The queues coming out of Superfish give  a clue to the quality of the product. I have an aunt who lives in Yorkshire and perhaps the biggest praise I can give them is that the fish and chips here tastes like the chippies from up north. The best fish and chips are supposed to come from here and the secret apparently is that they fry their fish in beef dripping. The queues mean that I haven't had a chance to ask the staff their secret but they produce a variety of fish with moist white flakes of fresh fish encased in a crispy but not too thick batter.

1GarKy9Cd25I1t6ISM8JQ,dIIKEfOgo0KqUfGQvGikPg,I've been to Coyotes games and a couple of concerts at http://Jobing.com arena so I feel that justifies a review... Despite an awful location (in my opinion) because it's on the other side of the Valley from me the facility itself is pretty impressive.  I spent time awhile back working at Philips Arena in Atlanta (worth a trip if you haven't been) so I have something I know well to compare it to... The layout works the bathrooms are decent (as bathrooms go) - lots of stalls clean and plenty of toilet paper... and the concession areas are spread out just enough as well (although expensive as can be but that's what you get at most public venues). We went to the Bruce Springsteen concert most recently and acoustic and lighting was top notch - we had a blast!,4,10,4/4/2009,dIIKEfOgo0KqUfGQvGikPg,260,1215,0

Lots of personalities traveling around together. Whew! We managed to break up into smaller groups and go off and do our own things. We met up to go on Soarin and Test Trac altogether thanks to the wonders of the fast pass which I highly recommend. Soarin was probably the highlight. Everyone agreed that was their favorite and worth the small wait even with the fast pass.

This is one of those restaurants that stay in business because they are good at what they do -- which for Pho Eden is making decent pho at a reasonable price. The beef flank here is better than many other pho places I've been to because it's not too chewy or dry. I really dislike when pho places skimp on essential ingredients but I never have to worry about that at Pho Eden. Also I love goi cuon or summer rolls. They aren't bad here but they are overpriced. Two fat rolls cost over $5. When we get lazy we just pick-up from pho eden and eat pho at home.,4,2,5/9/2011,rexGaH9i6qQ5fbIk4LFN0w,5,117,0

I had the Southwestern chicken salad (comprised of Red Onions Sweet Corn Mushrooms and Black Beans with Cilantro Lime dressing on a flour tortilla.) I found this disappointing. There wasn't enough lettuce for me so it was sort of just an open faced burrito. The black beans were incredibly overpowering because the juice wasn't drained so the entire bottom of the salad was a goopy mess.

I find Trader Joe's to have very low prices with a widespread selection of items in the store. Anytime I go there I pick up my staples such as TJ's Whole Wheat Pizza Dough (which is only $.99) Orange Mandarin Chicken (pair it up with brown rice or noodles along with veggies and it tastes like Chinese take out) Three Layer Dip Hummus or Kalamata Olive Hummus and Flax Almond Butter just to name a few. But I am sure to always check out their new arrivals stand to see if anything catches my eye (99.9% of the time it does).

Drinks: Great service busy evening amazing music playing (they have a regular rotation of DJs). I love the 70s decor and the decals on the wall not to mention the kooky artwork. 2. Brunch: the brunch menus are neatly tucked into old romance novels and the place seats about 20 people at most. The menu choices are terrific ranging from a flaky croissant spread with blue cheese and pears to granola breakfast burritos and french toast topped with heaps of fresh fruit. Unfortunately every time I've gone for brunch they seem to be short-staffed underestimating their popularity.

Its large enough to actually go for a walk. The loop is about a mile long gravel path plenty wide for multiple people and dogs to pass in both directions. There are little side paths that go down to beaches. There is a wooded hill in the center. At the entrance there is a very large grassy field where the main doggie play action seems to happen. The beaches are not pristine sandy beaches for people but sort of gravelly with some sand and stuff that drifted in from the harbor. In some spots the beach is very wide so the dogs can run around like crazy. The water itself starts out pretty shallow and seems to stay that way for at least 10 feet out or so and then gets deeper.

I had gyro meat which was just delicious and neither swimming in sauce nor dry.  I eat and love Greek food; Turkish gyro has slightly different spices and the flavor of the meat itself comes through a bit more which I liked.  Also the yogurt that came with it is different from Greek tzatziki and was a great match for the meat.  The salad was delicious as was the bread that came with it.  I tr,4,1,11/2/2011,0dhEvZdZeiSYXlqUWywBg,12,113,0

Instead of going into one of the comfy chairs they brought me a foot bath to soak my feet in. It's all gravy b/c you would think that it would be plugged in so the water would be kept warm right?

Well it was so nice and pleasant. Staff (Nathan) was attentive and very helpful. The food was good and so was the atmosphere. It was so hot out and we weren't sure Tuesday was a day that you can sit outside on their patio so being inside was not an issue. I had the New York strip which is ala carte. You have to order something else with it which I ordered the loaded baked potato.  They do take reservations but they do not allow you to bring in a cake for a b-day celebration which was understandable.

Doris offers a bewildering array of modern Italian groceries. Doris carries an impressive range of meats! You will find reasonably priced fresh meat and poultry. They have an amazing EXTRA LARGE hot dog that is too die for! They are constantly having specials. Their ground beef is also one of my favorite things here at Doris. Please make sure not to leave without trying some of their pastries treats cookies or fresh bread! Also if you are not in the mood too cook you can pick up food by the pound too! They have a large selection of hot food to choose from not to mention the salad bar which is a pretty large selection of anti pastas.

If your going to drink that crap at least have the decency to not clog up the best bar in Boston while doing so. I mean seriously you can get that stuff anywhere and for a hell of a lot cheaper elsewhere. I suppose that's the price of it being located in Kenmore.

For a massive sprawling airport DFW isn't bad but I have to say the features I like - I really like - and those I hate I loathe.

They didn't try to upsell us on anything we didn't want and spent a good amount of time helping us select what we wanted.  My husband doesn't wear jewelry so he ended up with a loose band since he wasn't sure how it was supposed to fit in the first place. About a year later we got married.  THIS was when he realized it was too loose as he nearly lost it on our honeymoon and at work.  While I heard that tungsten rings cannot be re-sized and have to be replaced I figured it was worth a shot to go back and see what JB Robinson had to say.

As a mid-price chain restaurant it is pretty good as a bbq place: its middle of the road. The menu has basically stayed the same except for the addition of the baby back ribs. We usually go for the meal on the trash can lid or whatever they call it. It feeds three relatively well and we get a kids meal for jr. The brisket is ok sides are ok cornbread is pretty good. The kids meal rib dinner comes with 2 ribs. Well basically two bones and 1oz of meat between them. The ribs here are more bone than meat so order a larger portion than you normally would it.

The parking situation doesn't make you want to stab your own eye balls out while you ram your car into a crazy soccer-mom either. What a relief!

If you are going to have a posh spot like this you need to ensure that the service is on point all of the time. Quality service means not waiting around for nearly 10 minutes for someone to ask you what you want.

I know some of the other Yelps compared Burlington Coat Factory to Marshalls or T.J. Maxx but to me Burlington is a notch or two above those other stores based on cleanliness size and organization. At Marshalls or T.J. Maxx clothes are stuffed onto overcrowded racks that are difficult to sift through. Burlington Coat Factory had its share,4,0,3/23/2011,yHKVmPE2YCZDvd9QCLag,9,152,0

Their final sale items aren't listed... but they tell you at the counter which is weird. Charles David has gorgeous shoes but why are they so ridiculously uncomfortable? Sales people don't try to sell you stuff and are generally blasé to customers who they think are just trying stuff on for fun.

Now these are still quite yummy. Piping hot I love anything that comes with a sauce to dip on the side and the seasoning was good. Not overly salted. Our entrees were huge disappointments. I ordered the scallops and they were...blah. They had no flavor on their own except for SALT. And this is how the rest of the meal went. Everything tasted like salt.

They're pretty damn awesome and are always up to something cool so I called my mom and she said they were planning on going to Dog Prairie Tavern for a friend's birthday. I agreed to go without even knowing what the place was and I'm glad I did! This place is a dive bar if I've ever seen one and that pretty much rules. I was shocked to see so many cars parked outside... there's a parking lot across the street but most people just park wherever they can. We were greeted by a really friendly guy at the door and had to pay a three dollar cover. I thought that was kind of lame but what are you going to do?

The server was super friendly and service was good. The cocktails as always were tasty. I stuck with the East India Cocktail. For dinner I tried the pan roasted chicken breast. I subbed the mushroom ragout for the asparagus which I'd had previously and loved. It also came with grits. All three items were great. They grill the asparagus which gives it really good flavor. The chicken was juicy and delicious. I thought it was a very good possibility that my husband had been on a night off.

It is a cute little coffee shop and I would say a good place to meet friends for a coffee or sit and read a book. I wouldn't say its a good place to do homework or conduct business like some coffee shops are. The baristas dress old school and take a lot of time and care with every drink they make. Their coffee is a bit expensive but the lattes and specialty drinks are pretty competitively prices. My latte was delicous and I didnt even need to add splenda to it ( I am a splenda addict). They also made a cute little heart design in my foam :) We got a dessert it was a salted caramel cookie thing and OMG amazing.

The last time I was here I happened to see the governor of Arkansas standing in line to pay his check in the lunch rush.

The staff was very friendly. We sat and read the newspaper and relaxed for a good 45 minutes after we were done eating our meal and the waitress kept bringing back coffee refills. They had some of the best customer service that I have seen in a long time. The food was cheap but wasn't all that good. We split french toast pancakes hash browns and an omelet. The french toast was the only thing that was good. But with that said it isn't like the food was bad just very ordinary. Also I though the coffee was overpriced at $3.25 for a cup although I got about 4 refills maybe they charge extra for the refills.,4,1,2/17/2009,FAxFj4HQChpKxF6KL0rMnA,87,485,0

And the spring rolls. Ah the spring rolls. No other Asian cuisine comes close to Vietnamese when it comes to spring rolls. And no other Vietnamese restaurant comes close to Pho Tau Bay's spring rolls! First of all you don't merely ask them to leave out the shrimp so you can enjoy your spring roll fish-free. Instead they put a giant piece of fried tofu in each roll (a large order contains four. FOUR!!! And for around 6 dollars) in addition to the vegetables and divine vermicelli (aka angel hair).

Forgive me for judging Westminster Abbey I was wrong and I'm not too proud to admit it - £17 is a veritable bargain for all of the history and architecture contained within.

Fast forward to 5:00 p.m.  I walk in to a tiny shop where a guy was cutting someone's hair.  I mentioned that I had an appointment.  The guy runs out of the shop and returns a couple of minutes later with a woman who promptly starts to fill the spa chair.  I said:  I'm not here for a pedicure I'm here for my nails (as I'm waving my fingers).  The woman looks perplexed and asked:  Gel?  No I said.  Acrylic.  The woman says:  Don't do acrylic.   Me (in my head):  I'm so outta here!  Disappointed that I'll have to return to my previous hair salon.,2,3,6/12/2012,5ITdf0mnklCpIUenv5LWw,68,478,0

1iVRESkPfD7Eu3txgoxtw,9VDrCkfj0IMDSDPgsPKFA,Brillobox is a great little bar across the street from the beautiful new Children's Hospital in Lawrenceville.  They have a garage-door style front wall that opens up to the street.   I've been here a bunch of times and always enjoy their excellent beer selection.  They've got about 15 taps that are constantly changing.  I don't think they order much of each beer because it's always a completely different selection every time you go.  If you love changing seasonal beers like I do it offers a great opportunity to sample seasonals from breweries from all over the country.  Both the bartenders and servers are very knowledgeable about the beer.  They're great at describing the choices and making suggestions.

This is a restaurant that seems more concerned with ambiance than food.  My husband and I dined here and he had the chicken while I had the pappardelle.  Both were lame excuses for upscale food.  The pasta was under done and had a terrible after taste.  My husband's chicken was bland.  We both agreed that it was not worth coming back to try again as chicken and pasta are hardly things that one should be messing up and a more complicated dish would make for a less than savory dining experience.,1,0,10/5/2010,jHX2qMpRIgW32vJgi50lw,11,171,0
1ixCQEQ8TCBzwRLAtF3jw,7dwh3pL2tbSeSvL0qLzUrw,For review #300 you have to pick a special place. This place used to just expand from one end of the building (on the outside) to the other. Today it spans the entire parking lot. Its true there are a lot of vendors who are selling garbage. It is a flea market. That acknowledged I have found countless items here from coins to hoodies to random things to hang on my wall. Its always fun to spend a Sunday morning walking down the aisles with a few bucks in your pocket and haggle in your heart. Everyone can find something they want here. Tips: 1) Vendor food eat it at your own risk but there are some real good fresh choices 2) The best stuff is not near the entrance its almost always by the doors to the building 3) The stuff along the highway (not in a row) is where you'll find the absol,5,1,12/17/2011,7dwh3pL2tbSeSvL0qLzUrw,24,461,0

But you know what? Worst seats at the Palace... still pretty damn good.  We had an unobstructed view.  The theater isn't all *that* big so while I wanted my glasses we could still see the stage.  And the acoustics were fantastic.  No weird dead zones or anything like that.  Ryan Adams sounded beautiful (and depressing... but that's on him not the Palace) And as everyone else has noted it is a beautiful theater.  Everything (particularly the summer movie series) feels more spe,5,5,1/31/2012,BNuSgYmwrJeOxSFan4HM9Q,28,182,0

Thank goodness I didnt have to pay but to pay nearly $30 a person for lunch with no alcohol is not cool. We all had soups and a burger...so that's uncalled for.

It was pretty shoddy. We had to do a lot of waiting and had to constantly flag the guy down when we needed anything. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes just to get the check after we flagged down the waiter for it. We didn't order pizza- we had a calzone and chicken parmesan both which had very healthy portions that we each took home half of.

I was in need of a new pair even though I wear contacts because I hadn't bought a new pair of glasses since I was 12... I'm 31 now... it's pretty safe to say my glasses were a bit out of style).

It could've been a low 3 stars but here's why not: - They only have rooms with two double beds or one king bed. The double beds are not wide enough for two adults to sleep on unless you're a jockey who's dating a gymnast. So if you're traveling as a family there's no good option except to get the king bed and a roll-a-bed for the kid(s) at $10 each per night. - Asked for a wakeup call at 8:45; never got one.

It appears to be a bit smaller than Radio City but it definitely holds its own amongst the grande dames of the music halls in the US. Let's see...think Loretta Lynn to Radio City's Maria Callas. Seats are comfortable and offer more leg room than I'm used to in an older theater (people were smaller back then. Probably around my size but even I like to stretch out the gams so I appreciate the room). The acoustics are fantastic and the sight lines are about what you'd expect in a place like this. Not perfect but it's an old theater. What I would like to see (cue the lecture) is people w,4,11,1/25/2011,0GQF457q0ZjKqh6xWiA,95,1010,0

Chef Matt Baier Did an outstanding job of creating dishes that highlighted the Rich Earthy qualities of this amazing Fungus. Here is a rundown of what we had. 1st Course: Morel Rabbit Galantine Morel Vinaigrette Sesame Tuiles Frisee and Oak Lettuce. Served with a Bruno Giacosa Roero Arneis. A great combination of flavors. The Gaminess of the Rabbit combined with the earthy Morel and the sharp tang of the Vinaigrette made the perfect bite.  The Wine was light and refreshing and a great match with the food. 2nd Course: Morel and Duck Confit with Chive Pappardelle Rainbow Chard Fried Sage.  Served with a Prunetto Barbera D' Asti. To me Duck Confit is like Bacon.  Anything served with it is going to be great and this,5,4,5/28/2011,e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,96,371,0

Hands down compared to any fast food joint Five Guys Live Oak Grill any bar I've been to etc. Bernie's Burgers are exceptional.

There were two main ingredients whose flavor came to the forefront - the sweet burger bun used and the grilled caramelized onions. YUM! I also ordered the Bleu Cheese Fries with bacon and green onions and they were ok. I don't think they were worth $7.

It's located in the food court in the underground pathway in the Hundson Bay Centre. They have a great display sandwiches salads soup and assorted baked goods as well as hot beverages. I decided to combo it up and got a sandwich with 2 salads: Ham & brie w/ basil pesto Panini with Sundried tomato pasta salad & Lemony Chickpea salad My sister got the Roast beef w/ creole mustard so of course we split half and half to get the best of both worlds! Both sandwiches were served on a white baguette and were equally good and fresh tasting. Despite how long they took to toast the sandwiches the insides were not quite as hot as I would have liked and the cheese was not all gooey melty as I would have ex,4,2,11/2/2011,PFNZVn73upq3oZDG2KnAqA,14,137,0

The interior is nice although the bar area that wraps around the kitchen is a little weird and I'm not sure I would want to sit there.

Of course there are so many family run restaurants that are better I would stick to them unless you don't have another option.,3,1,10/12/2010,wB8ATiDKotKsPjEPJgwtw,58,629,0

They're nearly all flavored for the most part which is typically what I like but for some reason I just wanted a plain tea yesterday. For plain black they just have a breakfast tea blend but for a plain green it's hojicha which is definitely not for everyone but oh so good and a surprisingly awesome choice. I think the only other green Mighty Leaf sells in teabag form is a dragonwell so them choosing hojicha over that gets bonus points from me. For $2,3,0,12/11/2011,8lH88XdzbQKTFg9WQZeuCw,47,339,0

The three things that make this store just an occasional shop instead of a regular habit are: 1. There aren't any seats.  I like to sit down and relax maybe read the first few pages of a book...   it's small not cramped but there are definitely no areas to relax and peruse. 2.

1LeaeTRsBJhvnm6k25E56A,adhDcleHPKoc0Cwx3hAYg,Went on a Friday night in February and had a great time! We stayed at the hotel which made it that much better but we had friends meet up with us and valet parking was $20 which is pretty convenient. I made a reservation for 8 people at 9PM because all these reviews kept saying how crowded it gets and when we got there at 9PM it was already in full swing.  The couch they reserved for us could fit 3 and then there was one little stool thing someone could sit on... hardly enough seating for 8 but the place is not that big so it was nice to have even a small area to hang around.  The inner section around the bar was packed but luckily we had a server and she was extremely attentive!,4,0,5/31/2010,adhDcleHPKoc0Cwx3hAYg,3,31,1

1LG2xKqiPxkYZXwocCmg,lxLvaKzRcN7gtxyywgRbA,I really like this mall!! Its huge so bring the walking shoes. Lots of store and great selection in stores not just the leftover stuff. It has a mid-level which has slopes great and highly convenient. It is a pet peeve of mine when I have to walk to the middle of the mall just to get to the other level. It has a good selection of restaurants in the mall its self like Cheesecake Factory Ruby Tuesday PF Changs and Rainforest cafe to name a few. Although there is a limited 'food court' as in fast food options. They have the regular mcdonalds and a subway (although I dont like the location of it its near one of the outside doors) and a few other small snack type eateries. They do have coldstone!!!

It's quaint with the small town feel during the day but once the sun sets the bars get busy and there is fun to be had! I was going to give this a 4-star review but the reason why it gets bumped up to 5 is because of the parking situation. I've never ever ever paid for parking in Mainstrasse nor have I ever struggled to find a decent parking spot - even during Covington's Oktoberfest celebration.

Line moved very quick. The girl helping me out was very nice. Verified my info and got me in and out during a busy lunch hour. I like that WF is not stingy with their check registers like TCF is.

1LosvCsVDIr4S9Rb3KF8zA,lQgBcKoDJot2nexLX9mZA,I really enjoy eating at this restaurant.  Out of all of the new burger places that are popping up everywhere this is my favorite. The burgers are juicy and cooked exactly how you ask for it.  If you ask for rare you get rare.  Perfect! I like the Dallas burger with pickles coleslaw and BBQ sauce.  Even the fries (regular or sweet potato) are really good.  They have a bunch of different sauces that you can dip into.  I personally prefer the Burger sauce (kind of Worcestershire like)  and the chipotle ketchup. It does get busy in there often but even when busy the wait is not terrible.  Their system of ordering first and then waiting for a table works pretty well. The milkshakes are pretty great too. For a surprisingly good quicker style meal..  I highly recommend BBP.,4,0,7/23/2012,lQgBcKoDJot2nexLX9mZA,0,113,0

No utensils and or napkins like all other tables. 3. The waiter seemed like he had no desire taking care of us. He was impatient and stared away at other tables when we were putting in our drink orders. 4. The apps took no time to come. I must admit the chorizo was quite tasty but be careful you will be repeating it for the entire evening. The calamari was ok but not cooked well and their antipasto platter is not enough to feed 2 let alone four. 5. The main meal took quite some time to arrive.

Therefore in a Mexi-Can craze we chose to visit Nuvo Burrito as the place to try.  We made the quick trip and ordered up some of the famous cheese dip corn chips and I got an Ozark Salad.  The Ozark consists of pulled chicken spinach chopped jalapenos (lots and lots and lots of chopped jalapenos) house made salsa and black beans - from what I can remember... oh and cheese.

Not much of a hot bar but all the other necessities are there. Produce prepared foods sushi butcher and more.

I've been to 4 or 5 different ones and they are pretty much all the same. I have no complaints about the equipment. I just wish that with how expensive it is they would make it a little nicer. I was there last night and there was a bucket in the middle of the floor to catch water leaking from the ceiling. Right next to this bucket was a new leak not being caught by anything but nearly dripping on me any time I was near it. This must be newer than the one next to it or maybe it just has not been noticed by any staff yet. If it wasn't for the fact that I can walk to it I would probably choose a different one.

We booked the hotel through Priceline and weren't treated too great upon check-in. We were told we were in a smoking room and that it was the only room available.

Apparently they're just finishing phase 1 of a 3 phase refurbishment Our badminton court was in the main hall which can accommodate 4 courts. The lighting was overhead but not too bad - we only occasionally lost sight of the shuttle. The court surface wasn't slippery and there was no breeze. The main drawback is that the prices here are high compared to nearby leisure centres for badminton. They lose a star for not allowing recovering Armed Forces personnel from nearby rehabilitation centre Headley Court (some of whom have had amputations from war injuries) to use the swimming pool when members of the public complained.

1NMNwNTXvlOiaLe7rH39g,DAeCY66njNMJJw4oAfNQ,Pretty disappointing. I was expecting LB's to be good as it is the Grand Casino's only fine-dining restaurant. Left unimpressed. Our server Frank was ok. He could have been more personable and he did seem to be going through the motions. For starters we ordered the Crab-Stuffed Mushrooms. They were delicious and came topped with this yummy sauce. The appetizers are all rather pricey for what you get ($10-$17). For our entrees my friend ordered the Shrimp and Grits. I went with the New York Strip based on Frank's recommendation. I tried my friend's dish and we both agreed that the grits were really firm. I am used to creamy grits. They tasted good though. The shrimp were tasty but small. My steak (ordered medium rare) was not cooked as requested. It came out more towards a medium doneness. ,2,3,6/12/2012,DAeCY66njNMJJw4oAfNQ,103,294,0

I also feel like the staff is becoming asshole-ish. The old staff is still very nice but there are some employees who are extremely crabby!

The first floor actually has no smoking paraphernalia and instead has plenty of tapestries clothing and bags. Colorful and bright it's a giant hippie trap!

Is it cause we believe that chocolate is a lesser form of food than a steak and therefor we shouldn't have to pay more for good chocolate? That's the reasoning and conclusion I would have drawn. That is until I actually ate the chocolate from Vosges. I was so intimated at first that I only purchased a few mini-chocolate bars a caramel sampler and a single drinking chocolate packet.

As I'm not really a baseball fan and live in Omaha this isn't acceptable.  After that initial response I did manage to get a hold of management who did refund half of my purchase price.  I personally felt that this wasn't acceptable but the BBB thought otherwise.  If only I would have known I could have asked for a refund the night of as management informed me via our BBB-mediated c,1,4,9/21/2010,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,133,725,0
